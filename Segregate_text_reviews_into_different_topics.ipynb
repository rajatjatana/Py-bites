    "# Segregate text reviews into different topics\n",

    "\n",
    "Why do we need to do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many a times you happen to have large chunk of text reviews and it is inefficient to read them all. If we can cluster them into similar ones and know what each of the cluster talks about, then our life becomes a lot easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "For a consumer product company who sells 1000s of cosmetic products. If for each of the product, we can ascertain that what are people saying about it's odour , ease of use, ingredients, etc. Also, for each of these topics (for simplicity you can call these clusters or factors too)\n",
    "\n",
    "That means, there are plenty of advantages of using such a methodology: \n",
    "\n",
    "- We can know what are the different reviews trying to say. \n",
    "- We can determine for each of the factors, what is the proportion of the reviews that are positive and negative, respectively. \n",
    "- We can find out the action areas for different sku's by pointing towards particular topic which has gathered significant negative reviews. \n",
