very tasty and easy to make on a busy winter night. hit the spot!
good and simple
Options other than meat + breads. No veggies gets old quick.
Delicious dish and easy to prepare. Tortilla strips seemed unnecessary and didn’t really compliment the dish. A quick “Johnny cake” style biscuit or roti would have been better.
would like to try different fishes
"Very tasty. Lots of flavour, and great textures. Would order this again for sure!"
"Pretty good, nice for a fast 15min meal"
"It was good, but the white wine vinegar was missing and the potatoes took FOREVER to cook."
extremely spicy
"The first few bites were really great, but then the sweetness from the tomatoes took over. I dont know what could be added to make it less sweet... but overall it was a really nice dish."
questioning value for the cost?
Amazing!
"Though I enjoy the calzones, this filling would have been very bland. I opted to add more of my own vegetables to increase flavour."
"Was disgusting. I love Indian food and ginger, but this recipe was not good also the sauce called for wayyyyy to much ginger."
Really liked the sauce - would like if this had chicken added
We Loved this recipe.
Potatoes were super small so I had to mash them as they wouldn't have made wedges
"The meat, potatoes with the sticky maple glaze was very good. Unfortunately the beans tasted somewhat mouldy so we didn't eat those."
was quick and easy to make - just messy to eat.
Fantastic meal! Great flavour all around
Didn't use the potatoes cause they smelled funny
Never had couscous before but it was really good .
Avocado was a far ways from ripe. Had to go out and purchase another one.
"Never received the order, but was charged for it."
Yum!
A favorite
spicy and delicious!
A little more turkey is needed.
Salad was great
"Found the turkey burgers to be too heavy. Might have been good to add mushrooms, onions or something to the patty."
I usually use about 1/2 tsp of the spice mix & that's plenty for me.
Not too many beans or just enough veggies to cover up the texture of the beans. All family members commented how good it was. I will be making this again.
Roasted green beans are now my thing. So yummy!
We loved this dish. We have been enjoying mostly your vegetarian options because of how good they are !
Great flavor. But the turkey patties were less than half the size of the bun (and we made them as thin and spread out as possible)
Second favourite.
All of the spices were missing-not shipped. We improvised at home.
Loved it!
I'm finding the quality of chicken isn't as good as it used to be. chewy and fatty are the two words that come to mind.
I didn’t have milk in the fridge so I had to use cream in the cornbread. it was still good. it took me 30mins to prepare not 15. was a delicious recipe
yummy!
Fussy to prepare.
yummy
Could have used more sauce
one of my favourites!
Perfect!
small bones were in the chicken
Quick and easy to prepare. I would be tempted to add some garlic cloves next time to up the taste.
Absolutely delicious
Way too bland. No flavour.
Sprouts were delicious!
"So tasty! The lunch meal was perfect, I loved the spicy peanut sauce!"
would have been nice to have a green vegetable/salad on the side
not enough meat to cover the bun and the instructions does allow for a crispy bun. Otherwise very tasty.
"Loved the creamy Brussels sprouts, will definitely make those again! Chicken was good too."
Meh
One of our favourite meals yet!
easy and tasty!
Loved the bun--so chewy and wonderfully crispy after being toasted
The cook time on the onions was way off and I burnt them really bad
A puttanesca should have a bite to it; this recipe was bland.
That was a good and quick recipe. And it tasted even better the day after when I ate the leftovers for lunch.
Needed a bit more flavour!
really enjoyed
one package of meat was open!
this was so tasty!

Good but a bit dry.
only thing I felt was missing was fresh garlic
I usually have not liked any of the recipes that had oeanut butter in the past but this one was exceptional!
same with these meal potatoes are bad and again so was the Brusselsprouts
It was okay. Probably better with meat than beans. Came with an orange pepper instead of the listed red pepper.
Absolutely delicious!! Added some tortilla chips which sent it over the top.
Balance of ingredients seemed off not a lot of quinoa - cooked this 6 days after we got it and our avocado still wasn’t ripe
"The coleslaw was really good , loved the chicken."
Quite a few steps but it was delicious!
It was way to spicey for me
Nous avons adoré ce plat!
overall very good. the dish is quite acidic and could use a bit more balance. perhaps some would be a nice addition humus too?
"Spice for chicken was good, Brussels sprouts were perfectly ripe!"
Enjoyed the crispy topper on this dish. Well seasoned.
"It wasn’t really bruschetta, just tomatoes and spices. Otherwise omitted the olives and was great."
Basa is not the best fish for baking-it's a frying fish. Would have preferred a different fish!
"The seasoning on the fish could have a bit more flavour, but everything else was great!"
Love anything with peanuts. Usually I do not like mango at all but the green mango pepper combo was great.
"One naan bread to be shared for two people for the amount of curry that was made is slightly ridiculous. Everything tasted alright, but the curry to naan ratio was way off."
"weve had other fish curry recipes form Chef's Plate that were amazing. This one just fell flat. Not awful, but not great."
The turkey was bland and definitely could have used some sauce.
"Good, easy overall recipe. Added a full, thinly-sliced onion to roast with the beans. Beef could probably have been sliced a little thinner prior to cooking."
Nice dish for a cold winter's day
the black beans that came with the order (in a can) smelled bad.

Super fast and easy
"cornbread took much longer than 14 minutes to cook, and tasted strongly of baking soda."

You forgot the yogourt and gave me 2 packs of the tomato instead! So disappointing.
"delicious! easy prep, great flavours! winner!"
Good
Lots of veggies and rice. Meat was very chewy.
Not sweet. Too sour.
It would be great if the red pepper flakes could be separated from the other spices. This one was a bit too spicy. If I was able to control the spice it would've been delicious
Super yummy and very well balanced meal
didn't like rice was horrible and didn't care for sauce
Great meal...
"I love lemon, and this was very very lemony. Also there was a lot of fat on the chicken thighs."
To spicy for our liking
The spices weren't in the bag. Disappointed
Easy and delicious
Cucumber was floppy and had to use our own. Naan bread was broken and sauce was leaking. I left a message to report these problems but have not had a response.
where is the meat?
This was delicious and easy to cook. I wish I had ordered 3 servigs instead of 2! My 2-year old daughter loved the chicken too :)
Would be good with some tofu!
"cornbread needed butter or cheese or soemthing, but otherwise this was a great meal."
Our box was missing one of the ingredients for the sauce (orange juice).
"Not enough naan, was too watery and not enough spice"
"needed more garlic and herb. Was okay, but very bland. I added oregano and more garlic, myself"
"""Was disgusting. I love Indian food and ginger, but this recipe was not good also the sauce called for wayyyyy to much ginger."""

wasn't as savory as I expected.
Loved the brussels sprouts done this way
chicken was spicy enjoyed the veg
"Overall nice dish! it is just portion is significantly smaller comparing with the other dishes we ordered, i.e. Asian Beef & Miki Noodles and Turkey Bruschetta Burgers"
"great taste, great crunch"
potatoes were rotten and useable as was the salad.
kind of bland. sad the is no fresh pasta anymore
Pretty bland. No sauce for the fries or turkey melts. Ingredients were sparse and unimaginative.
"Was totally delicious without the whole wheat bagel chips (to decrease carbs/gluten content). The mushroom ""bacon"" was incredible!"
Yum yum - we like it that there's such a large Asian selection. This one was very well received by my Chinese spouse.
we added cheese and avocado and hot sauce and they were delicious
Absolutely loved this meal! Already hoping it is back on the menu soon
"I added butter, frozen peas and halloumi ( had no paneer) to make if a complete vegetarian meal ( protein)"
The chicken was moist & the glaze was delicious.
Balance of the sauce wasn't quite right.
C'est excellent
My favorite chef's plate meal so far.
Not sure the exact flavour as the taco spices wasnt't included. Received 2 Cumin bags of spices and no taco spice.
"Never received the order, but was charged for it."
The greens in our bag did not last so we were unable to try this full recipe as intended.
a very nice light blend of flavours. the lemon and chicken go nicely together
easy to make and calzones were great to heat the next day
Pre-cooked potatoes for gross very quicklh
"I have always received fresh pasta from Chef's Plate, but this dish came with regular pasta that is worth 69 cents at the grocery store."
I felt it needed a little something to balance. We added a little lemon juice and extra salt. Overall great though.
Bland
"The meal was good (could have used more spice), but it took MUCH longer than 30 minutes. We had to cook a quick meal for our daughter and didn’t eat until long after she had gone to bed."
Taste was bland
despite being very thin the chicken wasn't cooked through even after 5 minutes per side. salad & potatoes were great.
Good.
"Wasn’t a big fan of this one, but its just our taste in foods. The beans were very fresh, next time may add something more to the potatoes"
Tasty! Salad was great & so were the potatoes.
"easy, quick and delicious."
Very good.
Really nice flavour!
Turkey bland.
carbs are too high but otherwise a great meal.
Loved this dish!
Tasty but more like a side dish than a main dish
"The tomato paste had gone bad so we had to substitute, but there wasn't a TON of flavor. But the cucumber raita was amazing!"
holy peanut butter overload Batman.
we found it oily
This was super easy to make but was pretty average taste-wise.
"excellent. easy to make, very flavourful, and a good touch of spice."
"This was awful. No flavour, the potatoes did not cook in the amount of time recommended .... ew ew."
Would have preferred brown rice. Would also like to see some edemae used for beans for some recipes.
This was the best plate I have chosen!
Quite bland and dry.
More spice and flavour
"loved this recipe. enough spice, great serving size, would love to have it again."
Awesome mix of spices and textures
Good taste but strange mix of flavours
Great flavour and easy to make.
So delicious! Added some tortilla chips to scoop it up!
Quite good
"commande jamais recu, aucun courriel de retour envoyé au support en date du Sat 2018-12-29, 3:13 PM"
Love the lime slaw and the fish was amazing..avocado could be a miss though. Overall awesome though!
lettuce had gone bad
"Didnt like the chicken , recipe said sear for 3 minutes took me over half an hour to cook and still didnt seem quite cooked. Was it organic/dark meat not the kind of chicken I usually cook."
a little more flavour perhaps but enjoyable
Delicious!!
no taste.
"Pretty bland, and quite expensive for essentially a rice and bean dish."
So so. Chicken had alit of fat and sinew.
Brussel sprouts were amazing - want to make them again!
I found the sauce a little bland. But the beans were amazing!
Fantastic dish! Very flavourful all around!
Good but getting fed up with the quality of the beef
Needed more flavour
Excellent. Really tasty. Restaurant quality
"Tasty, but skimpy on the cheese..1/2 slice for each serving? Why bother?"
extremely tasty
"Too many noodles, not enough veggies"
needed more flavor like an aioli
could use beef.
fantastic flavors
"It's got ""heat spice"" I'd recommend putting an icon on ones like that"
Only thing I didn’t like were the noodles for the lunch the next day. They needed to be a softer type noodle.
A little to spicy
Amazing! Loved this recipe!
Rice was not very tasty. Like minute rice
Need some veg
Spicy...and never mention of it
The meal was good but that was not enough mushroom for 2
"Wasn't a huge fan of this one. Too much lime flavour, couldn't taste anything else."
not a lot of flavour
"Good, but used my own bbq sauce on the chicken and not the buffalo hot sauce."
"Loved it, will make again."
very good and easy to make
really good and fresh ingredients and super easy to follow recipe
Really good
Yummy!
I added beef and crunched up tortilla chips for texture. Also added hot sauce and red chilies at the end. Was delicious.
Added ground Turkey to this - so good!!!
"Quick and easy meal got the job done. Nothing exciting. Buffalo sauce was a nice and easy change. Corn salad/slaw wasn’t popular with the others at the table, I thought it was ok."
"I would not get these again. The recipe lead to overcooked onions, and the buns were 2x too large for the amount of meat we got. This confirmed my experience that CP does not do good burger options."
Asian Snappeas and Mexican chips? What's going on with this recipe?
One of our faves - my son is taking the recipe card back to school with him (after I make a copy!)
The lemon added a nice tart taste without salt
Delicious!
excellent. one of my top 3 for sure
"Super easy to make, but was really flavourless. Also was not that filling."
"Overall, they were OK. A bit blind however. Two issues : 1. you only provided 5 tortillas, and 2. the avocado was hard"
"Basic food, wonder about valve?"
"It was delicious and easy to make, plus there was more than enough of that sweet sauce and some potatoes leftover."
Not the best recipe I ordered so far but ok. I had to let the steak cook for much longer than stated. I dont eat raw meat.
"meal was just ok. sandwich needed something else, maybe a garlic mayo or a dog dressing."
A few more tortillas would have been nice. Our avocado was rock hard - had to go buy one instead
The sweet potato took twice as long to cook as the recipe suggested and we felt like there should be more with this meal...rice?
"I didn’t think it would taste so good, but it really did. We both loved it"
This was amazing and delicious and bursting with flavour! It was so fresh and it felt like summer eating it which was a nice treat after all the Christmas feats I’ve had this year.
"Exceeded our expectations, very delicious!"
LOVED these
I didn't enjoy these at all.
This was yummy!
enjoyed I would order again
I did not like the mustardy sauce. It would have been good without it. I omitted the sauce for the lunch portion and it was much better.
The meat tasted off and the katsu sauce was better than past recipes.
By far the WORST chef's plate meal we have ever had. It just tasted like ketchup. We only ate it because we were hungry. I don't even want to give it one star.
soooooo good!
"This was delicious, would have been perfect with just a bit of chopped jalapeño in the avocado mixture for a bit of heat, and some pickled red onion on top!"
So good loved the whole meal!
Delicious!! Loved the coating on the fish.
"chicken was delicious. Beans came with brown spots all over most of them, so I didn't use those ones and ended up with a smaller amount of that side. that was disappointing. But was made was amazing!"
"Never received the order, but was charged for it."
good recipe and very tasty
The carmelized onion make this meal! SOOOOOOO YUMMY!
Good but messy to eat
Very easy meal.
Love the seasoned goat cheese but would have preferred a healthier side dish!
The bun was a little bit too big for the burger
It was good. Added more siracha to get a little more heat. Also lemon juice to the coleslaw as it was pretty bland. Overall good.
Didnt enjoy at all
A little flavourless - would be good with some kind of sauce
Good variety of flavors but pepper and tomatoe were not fresh
Saveurs bonnes. Par contre ke sachet d'epices était ouvert donc perdu une quantité et légume non utilisable car boîte congelé avec le retard de livraison.
Le plat était épicé et je n'avais pas vu cela à la commande. Par contre les légumes étaient non utilisable car boîte congelé avec le retard de livraison.
The chili was very good but didn't like the cornbread. We've had Chef's plate cornbread before and it was good this one was not
"This was my favourite of the three this week. Loved the coleslaw salad and dressing. Don’t think it needed all those potatoes, saved half to use for something else"
Loved this one
Always find the 15 minute recipes take longer but are delicious.
"Very tasty but the lime was nor fresh, and had little juice. ,"
Potatoes had an expired small and taste to them.
"Loved it! Would have preferred chicken breasts though, not a fan of thighs"
"This was very good, the only draw back was that the couscous package was open and therefore it was everywhere, in the box, in the bottom of the brown bag and then all over the fridge."
Not enough sauce
"Prefer a sweeter sauce when I think of sweet and sour, good but not my favourite."
"This recipe was fantastic, however the snap peas were mouldy which was quite disappointing."
Was very tasty and I would order it again.
It was a good pasta dish but we were extremely dissapointed to have dehydrated pasta over fresh pasta. This is the first time it’s been dehydrated.
Unreal
Yummy
Delicious
"Vraiment cheap, manque de viande, faux fromage, mehh"
Too much vinegar
Delicious! Just wish there were more potatoes as I had to buy extra for all the leftover meat!
Slaw and salsa bland
Dry pototoes... recipe didn’t say to use oil
Creamed brussel sprouts were so much better than I was expecting :)
not enough goat cheese!
Bland
Not enough Turkey for this size of bun
Delicious.... took some time to make but worth it.
"My 14 yo daughter and I loved this meal! My adult daughter was working the day we chose to cook this earlier this week, so we saved half for later, but got to eat it again ourselves tonight! Delicio!"
small portions and interesting taste.
added a little ketchup
"Good, but could have used more flavour/spice in the burger and on the potatoes."
Brussels sprouts were great. Chicken was way too spicy. Please separate the chili out of spice mixes so we can choose our level of spice
too much pork not enough sauce
Wasn’t very keen on the chicken spices but everything else was great.
So good!!
Fantastic!
We really enjoyed this.
I could taste all the different healthy ingredients. Than k you.
Needed more fresh ingredients on top like cilantro.
Amazing but I added salsa to kick it up a level
would have liked a green veggie side dish
Easy and delicious
The salad could’ve used a little extra flavour burst
Very flavourful
corn salad needed either more dressing or less cabbage
3/4 family members did not care for this recipe but the other 1 thought it was fantastic.
Loved it!
"Falvour was lacking, could have used some more heat, garlic and cumin as well as more base for the meat like beans or tomatoes"
SHORT 1 PIECE OF CHESSE
good flavour.
We added a chipotle sauce and buttered the ciabatta. Maybe some kind of sauce added to the recipe.
excellent!!
Dry without some kind of sauce
I liked how easy and quick it was to make. The chili wasn't as flavourful as what I make. The biscuits were a hit!
Super yum! Want again!
Really tasty but noddles were a bit heavy. Maybe a thinner lighter noodle?
Very flavourful with a nice amount of spice.
Have not made it yet.
LOVED IT
Juice of 2 limes is too much for 4 portion meal
"I found the dish very sour, with no noticeable sweet to counter balance the sour . I did not enjoy it."
"Tempatures listed were too high, but the flavors were incredible. Would love to make again more slow and low."
Not bad but the sweet potatoes took longer to cook than the recipe card
The quinoa salad could have had more veggies and less carbs.
Good but needed a delicious sausage or a crunchy green salad to balance.
My husband and I loved this one. I will be making it again in the future for sure
not sure coleslaw goes with it
The flavour isn’t quite as strong as I had expect and the spices didn’t toast well. I will likely add the spices before the potatoes if I make this again.
The basil that came in this kit was rotten! Nearly every time you send fresh herbs in a kit they are not good. Usually I can pick thru and find at least some usable but not this time. The entire bunch of basil was rotten.
My husband loved this one
Delicious
Just OK. Not my favorite.
"Absolutely delicious! The maple glaze is full of flavour, I added 1ts. cornstarch mixed with equal parts water to thicken up the glaze a bit. Also added olive oil to the potatoes before and after baking. I loved the spices in this meal too!"
"Excellent meal, nice spice."
very flavourful!
"4 stars for the taste and ease of prep. but we had to cook it for another 30 minutes, the potatoes were still way too hard after recommended cook time. tasty though!"
loved it
Easy prep good taste
So yummy. I know there was spicy sriracha but I think the recipe called for too mich sriracha. Should have put let. But if you like really spicy food then this could be good for you. Still tasted good
So freaking good!!! More curries please!!
Could have used more marinara sauce.
Avacado wasn't ripe but otherwise tasty!
The variety of textures were phenomenal - ate two full plates FAST
grated potatoes took time and they really stuck to pan when cooking....needed to use a lot of oil ...
I extremely dislike mushrooms so when the bulk of the dish is mushrooms I won't eat it
Way too sour.
NICE AND SPICY
Red wine package leaked
Brussels sprouts were disgusting
"Not bad, I had extra pork so I added it in."
"The seasoning is a bit salty, but the slaw and salsa taste good."
Perfect
Strange combination but we were sent cabbage instead of Brussel sprouts.
Did not like the chicken thiges no flavour not a fan of cous cous rice would have been preffered
Curated box with 3 vegetarian meals...Couldn't do it
"received my delivery monday, waited until Friday for the avocado to ripen...was still too hard to eat by Friday. kind of ruined the whole meal."
The flavours were great. It was a little dry though. Needed more ‘sauce’.
tiny salad enuf for 1/2 a person.. seemed like a very cheap meal for the price
I really prefer the individual recipe cards over the booklet
Delicious!
"missing ingredients - the oregano, and tomatoes paste"
very tasty! this pasta is very hearty
loved the flavours. bring this one back again!
This is one of my favourites!!
Tasted delicious disappointed it came with orange pepper and not red
We liked this one. Interesting flavours.
one of my favorite recipes!
This is the worst chef plate i have ever had very expensive for what it is... not much ingrediant and very taste less

We didn't care for the sauce.
"good, turkey needs good spicing this one was pretty decent. Crunchy buns gave good texture to dish"
something I would have made on my own. lacked fresh herbs.
amazing!
excellent! good quality ingredients
Per. Just the right amount of heat!
I substituted low sodium soy sauce. You may want to consider healthier versions of these recipes with less sodium
"The avocado should be delivered already slightly ripe. The fish needed to be eaten quickly after delivery, but the avocado was too firm to be eaten. The recipe itself was bland."
Simple and tasty.
The recipe was OK but the meal kit was an exceptionally poor value. Shame on you Chef's Plate for charging $20+ for less than $2.00 of food.
avocado was very firm
had to add spice to kick it up a bit. Also made rice for my husband
Small portion of meat and no real taste
Would be better with beef
Milk missing as an ingredient needed on recipe. Should put tip to bake cornbread in shallow pan or else center doesn’t cook in time allotted.
"Really good flavours, I had mine without a bun and was delicious!"
easy to make. could use more flavour
"Smelled amazing while it was cooking, but was just “ok”"
Absolutely delicious!! Loved everything about this dish!
Sooo yummy
Bitter
I think a thai sweet /spicy sauce is nicer
"Really good, could have used a bit more flavour / spice."
A little dry but tasty
I substituted low sodium soy sauce. You may want to consider healthier versions of these recipes with less sodium
Soft shells would have been great.
Although potatoes were precooked - many were still very firm in the middle
My son loved the potatoes! I enjoyed the corn slaw.
Yummy and super easy ..appreciated that I didnt have to dice all that onion. Would have appreciated another piece of naan though to have 1 for each person. Nice feeling like I can make indian food.
Wraps were stale ingredients missing and not big enough portion of fish
tastes better with the pineapple mango slaw
Delicious! Favourite meal of the week that delivered!
"quick, juicy, fresh. perfect!"
We really enjoyed it! Great flavour and easy to prepare. Nice portion size
"the glaze really didn't seem needed or that it worked, never thickened up"
Served it on romaine lettuce rather than the shell. Was very good.
amazing
"the avacado wasnt ripe so I could not use it but I used everything else and it was still good :) I would like maybe haddock, halibut or tilapia next time instead of basa fish"
VeryNice
The avocado was nowhere near ripe enough so we had to use our own.
should have been two pitas - one per person
More meat to fill bun would have been perfect
Needs more spice!
"Sauce wow, mais brocoli pas frais."
"This was SO delicious! My son said it smelled good, but all he saw when he looked at it was ""maggots and grubs"", LOL!....So I got to eat his portion too :)"
We had a familysize order for everything except the Swiss cheese. Only had 2 slices of cheese so used cheese we had at home (mozzarella). Tasted good!
tasted great!
Topped with Parmesan Cheese would make great addition.
"We added mayo to the buns, and topped the wedges off with any cherry tomato topper left. Delicious"
Very yummy and easy to make.
So delicious and the perfect level of spice!
"commande jamais recu, aucun courriel de retour envoyé au support en date du Sat 2018-12-29, 3:13 PM"
This might be my favourite chefs plate meal - and I've had hundreds at this point. I did add hot sauce on top which was great.
"Did not like the taste of the pork, had to throw it all away."
I used the while onion that came in the bag. Way to much onion ... but overall liked the food.
"Mediocre, the sweet chilli sauce is a big no for me. It’s loaded with fructose corn syrup and doesn’t offer much flavour. Otherwise the dish was okay."
Very tasty
the recipe suggestedthe shredded vegetables
Cheese was too thin.
R
would have liked a green veggie side dish
The sauce for the beef was delicious
Enjoyed it
Doubled the cukes.
We added chicken and it was awesome!
VERY EASY TO MAKE & GOOD TASTING
small portion size
Any time I've tried cornbread recipes from chefs played it is quite tastless and even though i hear the pan it sticks and makes a mess.
A bit bland
"It was very tasty. Couscous is a little bland, we added some of the honey mustard to it."
"We did not receive the cabbage OR carrot sticks for the salad which made a pretty plain meal. I was offered 1 plate as compensation, but we had 2 plates affected by this and have been loyal customers"
surprisingly really good! maybe more sour cream for the potatoes
Good.
Have already made it again another yummy recipe
The bread was a bit thick for the burger
Meat a bit grisly and no parmesan in kit
Ciabatta bun was the only good thing about this.
"Meh, mine didn't look like picture"
Really Good but the slaw needed sunflower seeds or a touch more flavour.
Too many tomatoes and half of the onion was ignored.
"very flavourful and delicious. one minor note about the recipe is that it wouls have been easier if it told me to zest the lemon first. not a huge deal, but I cut it before I realised I needed the zest."
Needed a sauce was bland
Easy but really bland
A salad as well on the side would be nice.
great... nice and spicy
Both dishes are delicious and different enough to stand apart from each other. Very nice amount of vegetables to create a balanced dish.
Potatos didn't cook in the time on the recipe.
was so easy to make well deserved lighter fare meal after the holidays!!
Bland
found there was not enough sauce.
Bread was bas
Quick and tasty
the broccoli was a bit rotten
Not bulky enough to sustain hunger. May need more substance like a protein.
a little bland; I had to add so much salt and some Parmesan to enjoy it.
Sodium contents are getting out of control. I have to modify to get the count dow
The glaze was over powered by the soy sauce
Soooo yummy. The avocados weren’t ripe yet but I wanted to cook this recipe right away. Nice spin from reg tacos.
Flavour was good but it was mushy
Excellent! Really enjoyed
"It was fine, just not very interesting. Tasted like a fancy marinara sauce."
Yummy burger.
the avocado sent to us was unedible - totally hard
Excellent
"Simple, tasty and overpriced."
First bad recipe from Chefs Plate but 3 different people tried and no one liked it.
I love this recipe! So simple and tasty
Really loved the maple syrup chicken
Great dish for the kids
The cooking instructions are awful (cook time too short and order of cooking ingredients seems wrong). Dish was pretty bland too.
yummy!
could be considered a bit spicy for those that may not like spice
Beans were brown so did not use them
"The lime was too overpowering, could have done with less."
"Slightly bland, could use more spice, and could use cheese on top (we added our own)"
it would be nice to replace some of the orzo with more veggies
the sauce was amazing
too little goat cheese & tomatoes hence dish is too dry; too much tuscan spice (3/4) for that amount of turkey meat
Delicious and easy
Really bland and gave me a stomach ach
Very easy and great flavours!
bland
Could have had more sauce to ratio of noodles
"nice spice, good portion size"
the green beans and parmesan are a great idea ! yumm loved it
loved this one! yum
Could use tzatziki and it might be better with small potatoes rather than orzo?
A little bland to us. Not much to it.
Even better the next day!
Everything was delicious! Wish there had been a few more potatoes and more maple glaze though.
sauce was too rich... very cheap meal
"Very delicious! My 8 month old gobbled it up, and my husband stop talking about how much he loved the maple glaze."
would be good to have 2 naan you cheap bastard :)
Never got the recipe in my box. Received a double of the Turkey burger but with only the meat for one Turkey burger bag.
This was very disappointing
Extremely bland!! Didn’t expect that with curry.
Rotten green beans and soft potatoes.
burgers were a bit bland
Sauce was a little thin. Not a great sauce / pasta ratio.
Easy to make and very flavourful
"First time cooking fish! Delicious and simple to make, tasted like it was from a restaurant"
A little on the bland side.
Really tood
Great flavors. Love the potatoes.
We’ve never had turkey burgers before but will definitely have them again after this!
Meat was too tough but the flavours were great!
So easy!
Took longer for the fish to cook
We did not like this recipe. The potatoes were not cooked even though I left them on longer and the spices were a little bland compared with similar recipes we’ve had in the past.
Very good
Delicious
"It was spicy, shouldn't have use so much sriracha - but tasty"
So-so.
Such good flavour!
So good.
"Good flavour. Directions could have been better, since pasta strands stuck together (a tip would be helpful) and directions for what to do with reserved cooking water were missing."
So quick and so easy
La même chose pour ce repas. Le poulet était coriace. La viande a toujours été excellente mais cette fois-ci pas mangeable
"Very tasty, but not able to get much crispiness on chicken. Too much cole slaw in proportion to other items"
"recipe extremely flawed, ‘fried’ chicken was goopy"
"The recipe was great, but the avocado wasn't close to being ready. So we left it out (it actually still isn't ripe yet!) and had to improvise. Everything else was good."
Good.
"So yummy, could use more bread!"
Smallest chicken breasts and hardly any potatoes. Basically a lunch sized portion
"Tomatoes were super soft, not enough goat cheese, vinegar made the potatoes soggy"
Really good! going to resue this one for sure!
Super easy and fast to make. It was also very tasty! Would make again.
Super!
fabulous
really one note
"the chicken was supposed to be vacuum packed, but leaked. Beans were a little slimy and turning black, not the freshest, so we had to toss a lot of it"
Omg this dish was amazing and spices I’ve never tried and was amazed how much I loved them! Will definitely be making this again
This was amazing!
Flavourful and filling. Perfect for a winter night.
"We liked the flavour but found it too oily, I would half the oil next time. Came together very fast"
"The family loved the Montreal Spiced Pork Chops (kids declared this to be some of the ""best Chefs Plate meat"" ever) BUT the potato gratin was not good. No one in the family ate it."
Absolutely delicious!
"Beans were old,sauce was too salty"
This was great & inspired me to make some chili cheese grits.
Wasn't a fan of the cumin. Ended adding more bread crumbs and a n egg to meat mixture.
Delicious!
"very mushy meal. Squash arrived squashed! And meatballs dont turn out like that when they are boiled in broth. The pic looks like seared meatballs,"
A little to salty.
Loved it!
I added some of my own Greek oregano for extra flavour.
"The recipe was ok the quality of the veggies were not up to par. This is a rare miss, but the cucumber was rotten and the tomatoes weren't as fresh as usual"
"Rotten food in box, sent 3 emails with no reply, gave up after 20 minutes on hold."
"Rotten food in box, sent 3 emails with no reply, gave up after 20 minutes on hold."
LOVED THIS! great flavour and perfect amount of creaminess
Very nice pasta dish.
The glaze was AMAZING!
Liked that this was low in calories but still tasty and easy to make
My package was missing the maple syrup and ketchup so I am sure the glaze would have made it better.
Really easy and tasty.
Had issues getting the tostados cooked right but otherwise a recipe I’d try again.
The olives in the potatoes were a great touch. Could have had a bit more flavor in the turkey burger.
one of our cucumbers was rotten already
Potatoes were a little dry without oil
"Loved it. Probably would use all fresh mushrooms rather than the dehydrated ones, just for texture, but otherwise it's great"
needed a bit more flavour but it really was delish ! The naan was amazing too
"Bery tasty! I found myself wanting a slice of red onion or the crunch of some lettuce, though."
Would’ve been better with a protein like tofu or chicken
The cabbage was missing which was very disappointing
The potatoes took much longer to cook than stated (often the case with all of your recipes with potatoes)
Not a pork fan
Quite tasty but might be helpful to include things such as how to shred the cabbage for other recipes
This was delish! Would have been great with some tofu.
This one was great! Loved the addition of kale.
"Great flavor, not overly spicy so the kids were able to also eat this dish."
Adding something like egg to the burger would help it stay together better while eating
This was amazing. The spices were awesome and the goat cheese was really good.
This was amazinggggg but so simple!
Hubby was a huge fan of this one!
"very good, created a million dirty dishes"
any recipe with chinese noodles in it is super popular at my place!

there were no green onions with the recipe bag and the avocado wasn’t ripe at all.
Just ok
"Beef was too tough to eat. I think if it had been cut thinner it might have been more tender. We’ll shy away from beef recipes as it isn’t the first time the beef was tough, but this time I it was rea"
REceived wrong protein (thank you for credit) but also need more sauce
Meat way too small on big bun
Applewood seasoning missing
incredible tasty!
"It was ok. I liked the orzo a lot, but the cobniation of carrots and beans was odd all together. Something like this would have been good with tofu protein - would love to see some soy veg options :)"
"I enjoyed this meal, but I couldn't help but feel it was lacking another ingredient... chicken/pork/crispy tofu/another kind of vegetable or two."
Very dry chilli and dry and bland corn bread
"Good for those who like Italian dishes (lots of oregeno in the spice packet), which wasn't quite my cup of tea."
kale was just not good in this
Would be great with lime
One of our faves!
Love...more please!
The whole family loved this meal
Awesome and VERY simple recipe. Loved the peanut butter sauce which made the whole dish.
I forgot that seasoned meat doesn't have to be in a taco. This was a big hit.
Easy to make and delicious!
Little bland. Yoghurt dip was great.
Takes a lot longer than the estimated time to prepare.
simply amazing!!!
Not my favourite
veggie mix needed more time to cook than was instructed
chicken had a bad smell so had to toss it. I used ground turkey I had on hand instead. worked out and tasted great.
Loved the creamed brussels sprouts as part of this recipe.

half the ingredients were missing and it was not very good
loved the corn salad.
Loved it!!
Salad was eh
So good!
It would be great to have a chicken version of this!
We never had creamed Brussels sprouts before and we both loved it. We probably would never have tried it if it wasn’t one of our meals.
"Produce was going bad, so were not able to make it."
We absolutely loved it
"Underwhelming flavour; also didn't pass the ""vegetarian kid"" test"
Was good and easy but not a favourite
Very bland
"needed more sweet, too much vinegar added some honey and it was great!"
LOVED IT
QUICK AND DELICIOUS
One of my favorites
Peppers and corn were a bit mushy. Last meal of the week
Brussel sprouts were slightly rotten.
"pork packaging leaked. Not as crazy about this as some other asian dishes, but it was good"
Enough food for two lunches and two dinners
This recipe was delicious.
Wish the chicken breasts were a bit bigger but it tasted excellent.
Elle manquait de goût...les épices dans les boulettes ne suffisaient pas à rendre le bouillon goûteux.
"This recipe was very simple, the rice however needed to be cooked way longer then the suggested time. It was a little plain, maybe more liquid (like tomato sauce) could have been added to make it more saucy. Overall still tasty."
the fish tacos are always awesome
Vegetables were old
husband liked.
"The pasta was good, but the overall dish lacked flavour."
"This recipe was great, but the cucumber we received was destroyed by the can of chickpeas in our bag. We had to buy another one to replace it."
Awful. We ate three bites each and tossed the rest....
also did not order so not our taste
Delisth!
One of my favorite fish tacos so far.
slaw was fantastic!
Very tasty!
Wasn't really a fan of the olive potatoes but the burger was good!
Left out the spice but delicious!
Not appetizing to what I thought
"a little plain, could have used another element."
Good flavour.
"Very tasty meal. The chicken was tender, the beans delicious. I would, however, suggest that the recipe call for olive oil on the potatoes before seasoning. Potatoes were dry. but still delicious"
Very much enjoyed this meal!
Great variety of tastes and textures
Perfect.
cutting carrots into matchsticks takes forever
yummy but I got hungry later.
"Something in this dish came out very bitter - maybe something in the spice mix, or the cabbage? Also, not enough acid - maybe 2 limes were needed?"
perfect amount of heat
bland
Need more low carb choices each week
Excellent meal! The only thing is that the chicken breasts were on the small side.
these were quite plain compared to other fish tacos recipients. Lacked spice/sauce
Error in the recipe - said to save some of the pasta water and then was never instructed where to use it. This was the second recipe we made (two days after receiving the box) and the basil was wilted
Tasty and simple.
"The package of chicken wasn’t sealed, so the chicken was bad and also leaked all over our fridge. Otherwise, the recipe looked good."
Lots of nice heat; super good!
Avocado wasn’t ripe even though we made it on day 4 and the fish had blue discolouring to it once cooked.
Love the flavors
The potatos and cauliflower took much longer to cook
always green beans and potatoes. tired of that.
"Not a lot of flavour with this one and the avocado was too hard to eat, even after letting is sit for a week."
the fish turned out great
Fantastic!
"I missed the cut off to change the order and so ended up with this dish. I was hopeful that maybe it would be deli-shish and I’d be happy to have messed up. Alas my husband and I ate some, and it was okay... kids did not like it and I through more than half away today which was painful for the $40+ we paid and that it was mostly potato’s and cauliflower."
"Salsa was kinda bland. And the recipe forgot 1/2 the chopped onion, so I added it to the salsa."
"Loved the flavours, especially the cole slaw!"
Plain.
Chicken didn’t taste like chicken
I loved the flavour of this dish! The fish was fresh and cooked so easily. Wonderful combination of spices and flavours. Unfortunately the onion that was sent was bad on the inside. I found one :)
The sauce wasn't very good and they're was no protein.
Soooooo yum
Did not enjoy it. the sauce tasted gross
Had good flavour
Didn't enjoy the beef but the noodles and veggies were great.
Avocado way over ripe
Delicious meal.
A salad or green vegetables would have lighten the carb heavy load
Spices for turkey were great
VERY spicy!!!! there’s red chili flakes in the “herbed spice mix” Usually the spicy recipes are indicated with a pepper icon and I adjust the amount I use. not enjoyable at all- I shouldn’t have used the spices at all
"The chicken was bland (even with the spices, salt, and pepper included)."
"This was awful, it had a really bad taste, and was virtually inedible. I’m a pretty prolific cook and found this to be the worst thing I’ve made in the past few years"
Couldn't eat - arrived spoiled
La recette en temps que tel était bonne mais heureusement que j'avais un piment dans mon frigo car celui que jai recu était tout mou..
amazing taste and quality!!
the Parmesan cheese could be better quality
"Pretty good. Only half the lettuce was any good, bun was Ok."
just wish there was a protein but super good
Was a good average meal.
"Poor value for cost. Vegetarian recipes should include a protein such as egg, tofu, lentils, etc."
needed more protein
Good but not amazing. Lunch was better than the dinner.
potatoes were delicious!
This was an AMAZING meal. Loved it. The flavours and spice was perfect.
BB date on cottage cheese was in two days surely you could provide cottage cheese that would expire in - day - two weeks or more it’ these little things that count And the cauliflower was in a sliced open bag
excellent .. maybe a bit more feta or olives
Sodium again too high. Modified and added chicken because it needed more.
Really delicious but the instructions weren’t very good about the tostadas
Not a fan of the green beans. Sauce for chicken too sweet.
"Really enjoyed the turkey, but didn't think the potatoes were worth the effort"
Very small portion sizes.
The avocado was not ripe and never ripened
taste like crap and not enough sauce at all
Delicious
"I should have only put in half the sriracha, I found it too spicy but my husband liked it. The noodles were very long so a bit difficult to eat."
"Really nice flavour, would have preferred not to have ground beef, but rather pieces of steak."
The chicken and orzo really complimented each other. Delicious.
"Love the sriracha sauce -- so spicy! For me, the perfect stir-fry."
"very tasty, just too small of a portion left us hungry"
"This was good, but I regret putting the whole amount of sauce on it. I think I might have even liked it better without the sauce."
Recommended time for veggies was too high and veggies were overcooked. Sauce was not good and meal overall did not seem worth the value.
Too much lemon
Why was the pasta not fresh?????
super tasty but it’s be even better with a few kalamata olives
Not enough cauliflower was all potato and also not enough spice. Not spicy at all.
So good. Needs less mayo.
"The potatoes tasted ""off""."

"Easy to make. It lacked a bit of flavor so I added a bit of ketchup and bbq sauce but it was ok overall. Im glad I didnt all of the sesame oil, it would have ruined the taste."
bland
Simple et délicieux!
Umm can I give this a 100 star rating? Really freaking good!!!
could use some mushrooms and onions. it was all carrots. was disappointed in the overall blandness of the taste. I'm a chef and wanna to try this for my web page and safe to say it wasnt what it could have been.
"Delicious, except the avocado was barely-cuttable rock hard. Not a nice, creamy texture."
the best so far
Not a lot of flavor
Was presently surprised by this dish I didn’t think I was gunna like it and turned out loving it
so tasty loved it
"Had a friend over to join us, so we just added some mushrooms and a red pepper. Delish."
Glaze wasn't sticky enough
Always live the burgers
So much flavour and lots of colour. This meal also made a lot and was very filling.
Wish the cabbage wasn't mostly the root.
So easy and so delicious!
excellent! red pepper is great.
Amazing and soooo easy!
"We liked it, but the peanut sauce did not look even remotely like the picture, it looked like thick peanut butter."
dry. needed a sauce.
Didn't like the noodles
we found it to be flat but had a lot of after bite!
"super fresh, nice healthy ingredients"
the chicken was amazing.
Bit too heavy on the salt/soy
Quite bland
Very low value for cost
"The Chicken glaze was amazing, the Zaatar spice on the potato was a little too much so we didn't enjoy that"
This was good but could definitely use some more seasoning
Meatball spice was alittle bit too overwhelming
pretty bland. We’re finding that the stir fry dishes (with noodles or rice) are turning out pretty bland... still edible of course just not that exciting.
Tasty but hard to eat! We made more of a taco salad out of it. I also didn't bake the tostadas for as long as the recipe said; they were quite crispy already after the first bake
did not care for the spice in burger at all
Beans were moldy and the chicken had gone bad before we got to make this so we had to throw it out.
Not bad for a veggie dish although could have used some unusual veggies to liven it up a little. Flavor was good.
"Excellent, best on yet"
Total comfort food. I was sick at the time and I loved it!
This was our definite fave this week. So messy. So good.
Best chefs plate yet!
"The time suggested to cook the fish was not enough - the fish was not fully cooked, should instruct people to the flip the strips and cook an additional 3-5 mins"
"not a big fan of kale, prefer spinich"
That glaze was great. The whole meal had fantastic flavor. Thank you !
Potatoes were a bit charred.
Lacked flavour
These were really good and I loved the bun!
This could have used more veggies. It just felt very unhealthy.
Love the bourguignon! Always a family favourite.
It was bland - would have been better with pork sausage
Simple and delicious
Really tasty.... this was the first dish that I made and it was really good.
Potatoes had no flavour
"Quite tasty! Loved the breading on the fish, loved the avocado salsa! There was certainly a lot of tang and creaminess to the dish but the dish was missing a touch of sweetness"
Not something I would normally cook but it was delicious and easy.
Very strong flavours
"Great, I added fried eggs on top."
"Love the beans, chicken and potatoes!"
Great potatoes. We may have liked if there was some sort of aioli to go with everything.
could have used a some spice or heat
it would be nice if the chicken breasts were of equal size. Loved the Parmesan green beans.
It was good except the basil showed up pretty brown and a bit smelly. This is not the first time this has happened with basil from chef's plate.
This was excellent!!
The glaze made it!!! Yum!!
SO good!
We didn't find it as flavourful as other dishes we've ordered.
Loved it!
Unfortunately the kale and the onions were bad by the time we got them but we subbed from our fridge. Really like the orzo and chicken seasoning!
I added more cherry tomatoes as I thought they were skimpy
"Good, but a little spicy"
Omg this was SO GOOD!! I never thought to do my potatoes this way. It was amazing ?? wish there was more veggies in this one though.
potatoes were great burger needed a little more juice or a sauce
"too dry, needed more seasoning too hard to eat hard shell. I think of it had she’ll like fish tacos it would have been great - with a little sauce or more salsa"
Did not roast beans.
I think my cucumbers got frozen in transport. Other than that this was a tasty meal.
So delicious and so quick!
Rice would be better as 10 minute rice as opposed to vacuum packed. Lime and miso don’t taste great. Just the teriyaki would have been better.
It would have been a 4 star but the quality of the beans was very disappointing. They were starting to compost already on day of delivery.
The sauce was kind of salty - probably too much soy saue
"very, very spicy"
So many flavours that worked well together!!
"Spicier than I expected, but still very tasty. Two sizeable portions - or potentially three smaller or medium sized portions."
I got my.kids to eat brussel sprouts with this recipe and they loved it. lots of leftovers as well which was nice.
Really liked the potatoes and the glaze in this recipe.
I’d like to suggest a five star rating system. I would rate this meal 4/5
Too spicy for my wife.
So tasty!
"the glaze was amazing, didn’t love the seasoning on the potatoes"
sauce was too peanut buttery
"We can do a better job by ourself then relying on this recipe. Very basic recipe, nothing special"
"This was a little bland, italian sausage would have been preferable to plain ground pork"
Delicious!
No beef in the box
We loved this!
avocado was not ripe.
"Breading on chicken too wet, did not “fry” well in oven"
A sauce would have been a nice addition to this recipe
I was not fond of this dish. Too many competing flavours...it ruined the fish
Loved this dish! Will make on my own.
Too dry. Bun not great. We didn't use it. Ate meat only.
"I put too much of the Pobloe peppers in, so it was a little too spicy,."

I enjoyed the noodle dish more. But both were very good.
So I loved the avocado salsa and creamy lime slaw but honestly the fish was gummy and not the best which was sad
Really tasty! So good that we replicated it a few nights later!
indicate in the recipe to start with just a little siracha sauce and add more to taste.
Delicious! And so much nicer done in the oven
Can we get something different hen green beans once in awhile
a lot of beef & sweet potatoes in one week!
Meat was a little tough
Don't like the corn tortillas. Likely won't order anything with the corn tortillas anymore. The vegetables were cut in pieces that greatly varied in size and shape...I ended up recutting the veggies
"Tastes good, easy to make and a large portion for 2 servings!"
was really missing something - chicken... also the carrot we were sent would have suited an elephant...
"Did not enjoy the textures of this dish. Also, too much lemon flavour."
easy and the fresh pasta is great. the dried mushrooms didn’t rehydrate all that well so they were a bit chewy even though I gave them extra time
"These were too ""crispy"" and lacked in flavour"
I found the glaze incredibly salty
Glaze was a little salty.
We had to throw out the cauliflower because it had an overwhelming smell coming from the box upon arrival which then permeated the fridge when we left it in the bag overnight. Very disappointed.
Needed more veggies
I just skipped the sriracha in order for it not to be spicy. I appreciate being able to customize the recipe by making it not spicy.
avacadoes where super hard. not enough shells
"This had a lot of flavor but not enough per serving, left my husband very hungry"
Just awesome. :)
Good portion size. Tasty. Preference would be to have a bit more vegetables for balance
"best recipe yet, cauliflower gives it a nice texture. I also cheated and added some bacon"
Just got the first box today. Although I believe that the rest of the ingredients for the other meals are all accounted for the chick for this meal is missing.
"I'd prefer a little less peanut butter, but my husband loved it."
Too much mustard in coleslaw but chicken and biscuits were great
Delicious
Unfortunately we container containing capers had open it and Spilled in the bag so we didn't have them or the loose garlic. I was able to clean off the other ingredients
"Is bag also had a container that opened, the feta on other ingredients. Still a good dish though and it's the first time this has happened"
"This was our first ever recipe, and truly was worth it. We loved it, and chefs plate made it easy."
"Added tofu, and it was delicious!"
very easy to make
This was good but the cucumbers had seen better days . . . .
even the kids loved it
"Meal was delicious, but sauce was not very good."
Could have used more cheese
We had the stir fry tonight and the beef was super tough and chewy! Not a big fan of the sauce.
It came with a different thick noodle tube. Needed some more spice.
Terrible
delicious!
the steak spices were amazing and the steak was so tender!! amazing
Not enough sauce! This was so dry. The fresh pasta was nice but the portion was so small for 2 people
Meal was delicious but the wasn't enough chicken for two.
"ended up only using part of the chipotle because it was too spicy for me. Otherwise, delicious!"
"Meh. It was okay, not my favorite dish"
The picture of the cornbread pan should be updated to show a smaller pan. We used the same size and it was a cornbread pancake
Don't assume your customers will have milk on hand.
Nothing special
Tasty but beef strips could have been cut up in smaller pieces.
"1. no almonds 2. the fish stuck to the pan unless you addede a tonne of oil, baking would probably be better"
cuccumber old and dented

making this tonight but will have to follow instructions on phone because card wasn’t included
Loved it thank you.
So delicious! All the flavours were perfect!
Disappointing. Needed something more. Was better with salsa the next day.
I loved this but I left out the spicy sauce
Not enough chicken
I was surprised my kids liked this because of the sweet potatoes.
My 14 yrd old son made this for the family and loved it! Very tasty.
over all really good. used the shawarma seasoning sparingly.
tasted amazing
enjoyed
"beans and potatoes were not fresh, soft and mushy before cooking"
Not enough flavour
"So, sooooo good and super easy to make. Definitely one of our favorites. Nothing left over for lunch though :(."
"This meal was surprisingly filling, I didn't think I'd like the brussels sprouts. I didn't even recognize that they were Brussels sprouts. Was really good!??"
We loved this one! super easy and flavorful
"Quick, easy, & Delicious!"
Added my own cheese
This was one of the best meals I have ordered!!! Hope this one get repeated and I get to order it again
Coleslaw was EXTREMELY bitter!! Not a fan of chicken thighs........odd texture (would prefer breasts).
The glaze and seasoning combined with the prep method of searing and baking made for some incredible chicken!
"We didn't enjoy any aspect of this meal. The chicken was very fatty and slimy, the seasoning in the biscuits didn't smell or taste good, the coleslaw was so strong no one could eat it. Most got tossed"
way better than it looks
Delicious! please bring it back anytime
Plus d'épices pour le poulet pour plus de goût...
"Recipe ended up making 4 burgers, but only had two pitas."
Absolutely love the turkey melts!
Cabbage was bitter.
Steak a bit chewy
"Excellent recipe. Again, I think that you should provide milk again in your recipes."
"The recipe should not have had the buttermilk and the breading coating I’m the same bowl. The coating on the chicken got too wet and turned out gummy, not crisp"
"This was so delicious! I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did, but it was a fantastic, flavourful meal! A+"
"So delicious! How can you not love a 3-cheese baked pasta?! I was a little disappointed that the kale was already bad, it had only been in the fridge two days. BUT, even without the kale it was a successful meal."
"the dressing was too thick, even after uppingvto two generous flush of oil, plus a bit of water. Also, the recipe would be improved by having a firmer white fish."
Good flavour but the beef was very tough...I won’t be ordering steak again as a previous meal including steak was also very tough & chewy. Maybe you need a better supplier of steak - or a better cut
dry
fresh.. spices were just okay.. rest of the dish awesome!
Really good !
The kids really liked these burgers !
Yummy!
milk not included
Excellent
Flavorful and easy to make
"this meal was ok, unfortunately some of my box ingredients had spoiled and the kale wasn’t our favourite texture in this, maybe spinach would be a better green?"
"the chicken and slaw were delicious but the the biscuits were flat as the homemade buttermilk did not turn out (thankful we had milk, but it didn‘t curdle)"
the fish was soggy. worst recipe ive had from you. but the avocado was amazing quality!
"this meal was disappointing, the seasoning tasted like dirt I had to throw my meal out."
loved the chicken and salad. not a fan of the couscous
"We enjoyed the meal. However, we miss being provided with fresh pasta."
The potatoes were not fully cooked and should have been cooked longer in the oven. also meat packaging is very messy and hard to open.
The potatos did not turn out well... They needed to be cooked / baked before being broiled.. poor instructions.
The chicken thighs that were provided were mostly fat and had very little meat.
instructions were not clear on breading chicken and chicken was not great quality- primarily dark meat + portions were tiny
Tomatoes were very mushy
Awesome piece of meat
too much peanut butter
Totally yummy!
Delicious! Stir fry is a family fav!
I realize I am a carnivore and need meat! A few meatballs with this recipe would be superb!
"Was good but found the recipe a little complicated, left a messy kitchen so not sure will order again."
Good but peanuts were missing
A little Pita bread would have made this perfect
I never received the order
Manquait de boeuf alors jen ai ajouté
"Another new favourite. Tasty and so easy to make. Might be a bit heavy on the peanut butter but all in all, a winner!"
"The chicken and the biscuits were fantastic! The coleslaw, not so much. The chicken was easily the best I have ever made!"
"Plain, but the green beans were good"
"Not enough rice, stingy on the veggies, and the one carrot we got was rubbery"
Fantastic!
Couldnt tell cheese dish was open and cucumber crushed etc.
"This was delicious - I found that there were too many vegetables for the amount of rice, so next day it was great with extra rice (I did not cook the vegetables for nearly as long as directed though)."
"avocadoes were not ripe so too hard, need more shells for ingredients"
"Unfortunately did not get my pork, but I’m sure it would be good. Customer service waa great when I told them my issue though!"
I think the directions need tweaking for the chicken. It did not look like the picture - we ended up not eating it!
Delicious!
This is one of my all-time favourite recipes! Delicious and spicy enough for someone who LOVES spice!
Great flavour and the burgers were very juicy
"soooooo delicious, and quick."
A little too basic. Could have used more veggies

Good. Nice and garlicky
"Amazing , kids loved it. I wish there were more in the box."
Really Great!
Peanut sauce very good
"One of the worst plates we've had. The coleslaw was bitter and the chicken looked nothing like the picture.. instead the chicken was wet and soggy. the biscuits were okay, nothing to write home about"
easy. It was like eating a flat crispy shell taco
"Uninteresting flavour, meat was tough."
This was just ok for me. Not crazy about how the cooked and raw elements came together. The plum sauce did all the heavy lifting rather then compliment the natural flavours. Turkey didn’t get an appetizing golden brown.
really good another sweet potato and one can of beans would have been better though
Very tastey. Wish there was more turkey. Lots of rice though.
I used much more water and time to cook the rice...
cabbage is super strong and not to my liking by itself. The biscuits were delishes (my favourite part) and my kiddo liked the chicken.
"very spicy, would be nice to have a way to control heat"
Took an hour to make. Patties didn’t stay together.
We found that there wasn't enough rice or minced turkey for the two of us and added to it to make a filling enough meal.
"Delicious! However, our bag was missing the burger spice mixture. I had to use my own spices to make what was supposed to be included."
Very tasty!
Great!
I liked the addition of the brown rice instead of the typical white rice.
"Wife said, weird ricotta."
"excellent, flavorful"
More flavour
I added some capers for a zing. And I had italian sausage that I added.

Kids loved this. Very tasty
A solid recipe. Will repeat with modifications - added avocado to the 'salad' and it was perfect.
beef was too tough and the peppers/onions were slimy
Great recipe but too much ginger in the sauce.
Yum!
"chicken was amazing, there was a lot of left over coleslaw though."
Delicious!
this was really good
I guess I didn’t cook the potatoes long enough. They were crunchy. Good flavours but not one of our favourite recipes. Very easy to assemble.
"Very tasty chicken and beans, potatoes were not as crispy as usual so was wondering if recipe missed tossing in oil first."
another excellent comfort food dish!
little spicy if we get the chance to order again we’d reduce the Siracha otherwise it was great
Interesting and delicious.
"Gave it a 3 only because avocado was rock hard...no big deal, saved it for another day"
"The chicken was bad, the potatoes were soft and the green beans were slimey! We had to throw this entire recipe out :("
We found this also quite flavorless and disappointing
This was fantastic! Awesome flavour! Would love to make again.
Never received this meal received one with Brussel sprouts and no recipe card
Nice and quick.
I liked it better when it was spinach instead of kale - would have been 4 stars
"The olives on the wedge fries was a little overpowering , took away from the flavor of the burger"
Fantastuc
We want this EVERY WEEK!!! ABsolutely DElicious!
those onions need a proper cooking before adding the potatoes. there's nothing worse than the taste of boiled onions that have not been properly sauteed. also the potatoes were coated in thick gooey starch.
This was not as good as the shrimp tacos.
very tasty. - not sure that the length of time to cook the rice was long enough
"Good, except the basil didn't travel well"
"Delicious, maple glaze was great"
Olives were missing.
"Cucumbers did not last until Thursday, qinoa package had a slit in it resulting in some of the contents spilling and worst of all the burger mixture was not included so I had to purchase bread crumbs to finish my meal"
Anything with a peanut sauce is good!
Needed more flavor
unfortunately my basil was completely wilted so we couldn't use and I didn't have any on hand. But everything else tasted excellent!
amazing
Kale salad was frozen in the middle of the bag and potatoes were not well cooked
Pretty good but not enough feta cheese! I tripled it with my own feta.
Dressing didn't turn out and didn't like the millet.
I was excited for this one but was disappointed. turkey was bland. carrots were bland. Napa cabbage was all stalks and too spicy.
"Missing buttermilk biscuit mix, meat was not good, nor was it worth the money"
"The glaze was too salty, but the chicken was moist and tender"
So tasty and colourful. I will try to make these again.
"Pork and salad were great - ""roasted potatoes"" provided with instructions to broil only were raw"
"I felt that there wasn't enough cheese sauce for the gratin. Otherwise, it was very good."
Loved it.
My kid loved the beans!
greens had gone bad but the other ingredients were quite delicious. went back for seconds.
Chicken was not crispy like the photo
"The glaze was far too salty, but I love the applewood spice."
"chicken was incredibly tender, biscuits were moist!"
too many flavours going on
"""precooked"" potatoes were black and rock hard."
"SOOOO good - light, low cal and easy to serve as leftovers!"
"the recipe for the potatoes called for broiling but even after an extended time period, they were still rock hard, half raw."
just didn’t like the flavour
I tried the cauliflower Mac and Cheese a few weeks back.. I liked the texture so much that I brought it into this recipie and made cauliflower 'rice' instead of adding it as whole pieces. Delicious!

The steak was way better than it looked! Didn't cook it as long as recommended and the ricotta sauce was amazing
yummy but missing ingredients and mushy greens
Really good but I was still hungry.
Loved the volume of food!
Best burger of life.
SO GOOD!!! Nachos will never be the same
I make this often(similarly)
"The paper towels completely stuck to the bread, kinda ruined the entire thing.."
Too spicy and too fat
Fairly easy to put together and a good combination
Really liked these burgers and the fact that the whole meal was made in the oven. Easy cleanup!
"Liked this entree a lot, the couscous was a bit plain but the chicken was great and the hummus and dills on the side were nice extras that put this meal over the top."
the chicken did not look like the picture at all
Needs more flavour. Good idea though
Definitely not worth the money. Disappointing.
Kids loved it
a bit bland
potatoe spices didn’t seem to blend with the rest of the plate
Excellent. Love the turkey burgers. We pick them every time!
Very tasty but needs too many pots.
Loved It!!
sour cream would have been better than the mayonnaise on the slaw
Absolutely delicious!
Didnt get our recipes. Theyvwere delivered to the wrong street
Recipe called for lemon zest which was missing on ingredient list and not included in bag. There were no directions to zest lemon either. VERY confusing.
"Delicious! But come on, no cheese?"
Vinegar on the potatoes made them soggy! Would recommend removing from the recipe
Perhaps adding cilantro to salsa would be good
Maybe a few more potatoes
Very tasty and easy to prepare
"Chicken and green beans were great, but the spice mix on the potatoes had a mouldy taste"
Delicious recipe! We’ll be making this easy glaze ourselves for sure!
Difficult to prepare
This was one of the best meals yet!
Really good; the parm green beans stole the show!
"Delicious, but wasn’t filling enough for dinner for 2 people."
"A little bit more veggies, like peas, would have made this recipe perfect."
delicious
"Really tasty and satisfying ,and reheated nicely for lunch the next day."
80% of your daily sodium in 1 serving are you crazy!! and there were no carrots included in my bag - they were missing
Everyone in the family liked this one.
Definitely kid friendly if you don't use all the sriracha!
YUM! I wasn’t too sure on this one. But I was pleasantly surprised! full of flavour with a bit of spice. would definitely have again
yum!
"Too spicy for me, but son loved it!"
I would prefer to use different mushrooms
"Not my fave recipe but tasted ok and was super quick to make. The quantity too was good, enough for 2 plates and lunch the next day."
We loved it but the Dijon mustard was too strong of a flavour for the sauce - also we had 1 chickpea and 1 butterbeans - was that intentional?
Un coup de coeur....vraiment bon!
"Was delicious, but would have preferred couscous or quinoa"
This was awesome! It inspired me to go out and buy some Siracha to make the sauce again!
This took 30 minutes. I was expecting it to be a quick meal since it was advertised as 15
Was good but a little bland.
Bit hit with grandkids
Love this dish. spicy Asian KICK!
"The cut of beef wasn’t great and not really a big serving for dinner at 5 ozs. Seasoning for meat was good, seasoning for potatoes was pretty mild."
sauce was heavy
Super tasty! Would eat again tasted like I ordered it from.a restaurant!
amazing meal!!
We loved this one
You never sent the Turkey :(
Very good
Tasty and simple
potatoes didn't cook. was not very spicy
loved the chilli but didn’t enjoy the flavour of the sloppy joes as much
"The salad was so bitter that we couldn't eat it. The two starts are just because the biscuit and chicken were good, but can't ignore that overall very unsatisfying meal"
Excellent
Too much mayo! Biscuits turned out flat. Chicken was good.
Good! Would have been better if potatoes were cut thinner so they were more crispy
it was delicious
I was not sent the shawarma spice!!!
Do you plan on doing vegan recipes any time soon?

Beef was tough
Salad turned out to be very mustardy
the steak and sauce were my favourite
Sweet potatoes are hard to crisp without burning.
"The chicken had gone bad before the best before and the carrot was inedible rubber, so we actually never found out how it tasted."
"Buscuits were ok. The chicken breaded extremely weird. The recipe said to mix the breadcrumbs into the butter milk, which made this paste like “breading” if you could call it that? Strange."
"Inedible. Potatoes actually stunk of the plastic they were sealed in. chops were ok, but the kale salad dressing was just mayo and vinegar which was awful. Had to cook another meal to replace this one"
"Chicken was great, I didn’t particularly like the flavour of the coleslaw and biscuits"
Enjoyed! Easy and tasty :)
Really really good!
So-so
Easy meal to make
could have used more sour cream :)
I added additional Montreal stake spices
Loved what the ricotta vinaigrette brought to the classic steak and beans recipe
lacking flavour
burgers were a little bland and didn’t stick together. Salad and yoghurt were delicious
This one was a little weird. Maybe not enough curry? Maybe shouldn’t have been called Mac and Cheeze as it wasn’t very “cheezy...” We did like the crispy shallots and the portion of spinach was excellent
the recipe said chicken breast however we received chicken thigh...
I made the potatoes as fry shaped and they looked even prettier - -steak frites.
Was glad I could leave out the sriracha.. Not a fan... Otherwise this recipe was great.
felt like it was missing something good flavour but wouldn’t make again
No flavour. Not a fan of precooked rice.
didn’t use the sour cream - would have appreciated being able to omit from delivery to minimize food and packaging wastage.
"chewy/gristley beef, needed more water for rice (instructons not good)"
the chicken was pretty terrible. very low quality. and not enough ingredients to coat the chicken to make it “fried”
Would benefit from more sauce
Loved it!
Too much mustard in salad. Also would be much better with chicken breasts instead of thighs.
biscuits were underwhelming.maybe cheese would help?
Both the carrot and Napa cabbage were expired
We love the flavours in this recipe!! Both the dinner and lunch were fantastic!!
"Surprising hit, great flavour. Hope to see again"
"J'ai aimé les pains au babeurre, mais je trouve ça décevant que le raccourci d'utiliser un mélange tout prêt soit utilisé.... dur à refaire. Sinon, le reste n'était pas à mon goût."
The pepper provided had a large hole
The couscous was good but felt like it needed an extra note of flavour (possibly like some currants or cranberry to give it a boost)
The meal was quite heavy with oil; not overly appetizing and little flavour other than just some heat.
Didn’t like the taste (spices)
Awful taste
Excellent
this was incredibly delicious!
good. tasted like holiday festive meal.
bit too much soy sauce and potatoes need more seasoning
Awkward to eat and not much flavour
I'm afraid to say that this recipe was awful. The curry bland very acidic from way too much tomato. The salad and naan were nice but the curry...not so much
this dish was very good
small portions and no greens
Super dry meatballs. There is a reason why normally in meatballs one ads bread crumbs and egg and veggies and not just meat mashed together. Quick and easy comes at the cost of decent food here...
tasty but low value and low protein
"Rotten food in box, sent 3 emails with no reply, gave up after 20 minutes on hold."
"Parmesan green beans were good, but alittle bit too salty."
would like a little more orzo
Very solid-I could have eaten more.
"very good!! would have also loved it with halloumi instead of the feta to beef it up a bit more, but overall great dish!"
Meat tasted grainy and low quality
Complex flavours. Very tasty. we were not completely crazy about yams as the veg and it would have been more visually appealing with addition of something green.
Delicious!!
Taste was good. instructions were a problem. The green beans and chicken fit don'tfit onn one pan. Roasting potatoes in oven w green beans meant the greens were somewhat steamed and parmesan not cris
We loved this dish!
Sour cream would have been great to have as well
we loved this one!! the lime with the salsa to die for. We added cilantro and sour cream too
"Perfect, tasted great."
Too bland
"Delish but could be better with shorter noodles (recipe has long Asian style spaghetti, a bit too long for a “stir fry”)"
I’ve made crispy fish tacos from chefs plate before that had more ingredients and therefore tasted better.
These were easy and great flavour !
"Dinner was delicious, lunch option was not so great."
I love a traditional Aloo gobi ... this was more like a basic curry dish. the naan bread was good.
Chicken and sauce were good.

Easy and yummy.
Much better than I thought!
"Green beans were amazing, I can't find them in the stores as good as what you guys provide with meals. Chicken came out very juicy and I loved the glaze on it."
"Meal was pretty skimpy, even though we added chicken. Needed rice and maybe another vegetable, like carrots."
This was awesome! It fed our family of 4 plus 3 extra kids and the kids could not stop raving about it!
Delicious comfort food! Very generous portions as well.
Ok. Needs fresh tomatoes or maybe a pico de Gallo instead of salsa. Cheese?
Pretty average.
"Surprisingly tasty and certaunly filling! It inspired our family to think of more ways to make similar easy, veg meals in the future"
I thought it was okay but my wife loved it!
potatoes were not good
The green beans were delicious. I would use less soy sauce in future.
Cabbage was old could not shred it the lime slaw was too bitter I would use less lime Cucumbers were pretty soft
Recipe was great but carrot was so old i could bend it in half without breaking. Fresh produce should be key. This not the first time carrots are rotten
Did not like that the rice was pre-cooked/Minute Rice. Would rather just cook it from regular dried rice
Love it . Great taste and portion! A 10 out of 10!
"Was milk supposed to come with this recipe? We didn't have any, so we improvised with slightly watered down cream. Didn't work well-- the vinegar separated the cream and water. Made a bit of a mess."
"Bland, ended up throwing it out. The thought was there for a creative recipe but it fell flat and not enough veggies."
Awesome.
Soooo delicious!
didn’t love the kale...probably would have preferred spinach in this recipe
Delicious and easy to make but didn’t come out exactly as photographed but delicious none the less!
Great to take a break from meat and so filling!! Really delicious and so easy!
Très bon au goût mais portion déraisonnablement trop petite
Too greasy for my taste
"chefs plate always used to provide all the main ingredients needed for the recipe. I didn’t have milk, so I wasn’t able to make this recipe. It’s dissapointing to see these types of changes lately, and no real communication about these changes. Maybe an alert that pops up that warns people that they will need to buy their own ingredients!"
Awful!! And the biscuits did not work.
"Loved everything about this. The spice of the chicken, cous cous, the ease of putting the entire dish together was easy and delicious"
Missing a key ingredient (buttermilk)
The dressing on the coleslaw was lazy and disgusting. There was nothing in advance of ordering this dish that told us we needed to have milk. The chicken was pretty good but tiny portions.
Our kit was missing the cilantro :(
Steak was full of fat. Almost non edible. Ricotta and vinegar are not a good combination
This dish was really yummy and I'd like to see it regularly in the weekly recipes selection. Really nice vegan version of mac and cheese. Thanks!
Tasty
Chicken didn’t really crisp up. Biscuits were a bit dry
Spinach would have been better than kale.
Fantastic recipe and different from what I would cook on my own.
preferred white meat
fresh mozzarella would work better and basil
amazing steak
Really didn’t enjoy the flavours of this dish at all and we normally really enjoy the fish on a grain meals.
added my own Italian sausage to make this meal a little more hearty
Not all ingredients were in the bag. Got two peppercorn spices and no paprika
it would be helpful to know that milk will be needed for a recipe when ordering
Excellent but suggest the sweet potatoes be cut thinner.
Really good. I might cut down on the ginger next time.
The smoky applewood seasoning was missing from the bag.
The recipe needed more chicken. One thigh each isn’t enough. One biscuit each would have been fine.
Flavours were delicious. Recipe came together easily.
delicious couldn’t get enough.
got 3 servings out of this??
bland
Very good.
Missed the fresh pasta
"Delicious, but needed a wrap or something tortilla-ish, so we augmented with toasted pita bread!"
Great mix of flavours!
"We received 3 chicken thighs for 2 people??? Not sure how this is classified as a meal. Not impressed. Biscuits turned out flat, my recipe is way better"
One of my favorites so far
didn't love the dill in coleslaw. A different flavor may have been better
chicken was a hit
Meh. I’ve had better.
"It was tasty, but not a fan of ground turkey."
the tostado part was too hard and crunchy.
Excellent meal and really easy
Sooo Yummy
"Needed more sauce/flavor. The cooking directions for the rice was not correct, it was very dry and uncooked"
The flavours were great. Just not enough colour. It would have been nice to have something green or red in the recipe.
Better than expected
A lot of the green beans had gone mushy. Rest was fine.
Was a little bland and boring. Maybe chicken cooked with the sauce may have been a lil better.
not enough naan
Everything very dry and hard to get through though tasty.
"Tasty meal and yummy, hearty, and satisfying lunch"
Amazing flavour. Noodles got a bit mushy.
Only bc not big fans of sweet potatoe- bad decision by mom
Easy to make but very dry (needs more cream)
"Really good, but not enough portion size."
Good!
The cucumber we received for this order was very soft and almost not able to be used. I was able to salvage half of it. That was a bit disappointing.
Just ok. A bit plain but we loved the beans!
"Tasty, but messy to eat"
"Avocado was rock hard and not at all ripe, we couldn't use it for recipe which was disappointing"
a little tasteless
Broccoli went bad quickly.
Green beans were excellent! No oil used on the potatoes though so they were very dry
Really really good
The flavours were too strong for us.
Delicious!
sauce too salty and chicken portion was small
Probably my fav meal of the week; absolutely delicious!
We like this meal
Needed more maple syrup and less soy sauce to make the glaze
SO delicious and lots of mushrooms
"Very good...we added some chicken to ours, it was great!"
green beans were still raw after 15 minutes
Delicious!
Surprisingly satisfying. I expected to miss a conventional protein but the peanut went a long way.
Some of the produce had gone bad so that could have impacted the flavour - because of missing items. It was ok - just not great.
the instructions left out what to do with the pasta water kept after cooking the noodles
"In the photo, the tortillas are deceptively browned. Very tasty, though."
didn't quite like this. I thought it needed something green. I also found I didn't like the olives on the potatos.
"it didn't say what temperature to use for baking the wonton wrappers, but 425°F seemed to work all right. A great first recipe!"
Beans were awesome
Le poulet était très coriace. La viande a toujours été délicieuse
Avocados were not ripe at all
"Cabbage is always too hard to shred thinly, should come pre-shredded"
The chicken and green beans were great. But the potatoes fell short. We really didn't like that the recipe called for no oil. The result was the potatoes tasted a little earthy.
"The broccoli I received for this recipe was unusable. This is a repeat issue when the broccoli is packed in a vacuum sealed bag. It has a foul odor and tastes just as bad. When the broccoli arrives in a zip lock bag I never have this issue. The recipe itself was tasty, I would have rated it a 4, but had I noy purchased my own fresh broccoli and used the broccoli and used the broccoli provided it would have been ruined."
Quite flavourful
The onions and the green peppers were so slimy ~ luckily I had an onion and a red pepper to use. Otherwise it was tasty. Poor quality contros seems to be happening more and more.
Added some spicy mayo for an extra kick! iI did end up with to many Cucumbers
Amazing!
delicious
This was delicious
"Mmmm. This sauce was so simple, yet packed with savoury flavour."
"Would have preferred if the fish was fried, not baked"
Need bigger portions we were still hungry
Delicious. Loved the gluten free wrapers.
"quick, delicious, light AND filling!"
"linguini should have been cooked longer, otherwise good"
Didn't have a lot of flavour
Added some bok choi for more vegetables...very tasty
not bad but wish the pasta was fresh
"Good fish, poor toppings"
Great flavours and fun to make.
LOVED IT!
Way too spicy with the whole amount of sriracha
can never go wrong with Asian.
very good
This tasted good but very low value for money spent
enjoyed the spice and flavor combinations
This was a major hit in our household. Everyone loved this
Best meal yet!! So tasty.
needs a little more rice
We added beef to this recipe and loved it!
soooooooo good!!!
Really easy to make and quite tasty too.
Moist and great flavors!
Quite yummy. I think it would have been even better with a pasta that was smaller and/or the instructions said to chop the mushrooms smaller.
"The potatoes ended up hard because of the lack of oil. Otherwise, the dish was delicious."
The potatoes took away from the curry taste. Made the dish very bland. Needed more spice or less potatoes.
"I didn’t use the recipe at all because the ingredients were weird, the buns were great and the seasoning was ok."
Very sour
Loved this recipe
Burgers needed extra ingredients to give them a better texture and the olives were not the best tasting ones I've had.
We love this avocado salsa and this recipe. It was very good !
"Burgers a little dry, some sort of sauce would have been nice rather than goat cheese."
Chicken seasoning was so good!!!
Tostadas are always great!
A little bland in flavor and the skin left on the potatoes were hard to eat. I had to spit them out.
I didn't know that milk was no longer supplied
They were delicious. I didn't realize it was tilapia so I bought another kind of white fish to use because I won't eat tilapia.
Fun to cook these and they tasted great.
"Pretty darn good, will definitely make these another time."
"Loved this! Quick, easy and full of flavour."
The focaccia buns were too tough to use as burger buns . We didn’t care for the choice of bread.
The turkey burgers and goat cheese were delicious but we served bruschetta on the side so the bun stayed crispy.
yummy
easy to make and very tasty
Very tasty!!!
did not order so we did not like it
Too spicy!
New Years Eve worthy!
delicious!... thoroughly enjoyed it!... maybe add some crunchy toppings for the salad (a few nuts or something?)
Excellent flavours.
"For the ratio of all else: veg, even more cabbage would be awesome. It really disappears."
Yummy! This recipe made A LOT of food :)
portion seemed a bit small but delicious
Nice flavour and the pasta was really good and fresh.
"Quick, easy, tastes great. Thankyou."
pretty good though a little heavy on the raw garlic
Cherry tomatoes never survive in packaging
The tostadas? Not good. We ended up throwing them out and using flour tortillas instead
Both the Tuscan Spice and Ground Sumac were missing from the contents of the bag. Unfortunately I didn't have these available so it made the burger very bland.



This was easy to make and delicious!
This was so delicious ! The Whole family enjoyed !!! A great and delicious way to get the family to eat some more vegetables :)
"instructions about batter of chicken unclear, they seem to say add batter to buttermilk/chicken mixture, not put in a separate bowl"
Very tasty.
avocado was not even close to being ripe and was still hard as a rock 5 days AFTER receiving our box
The tomatoes were rotten within 3 days of receiving our box
ingredients were not fresh and flavours were just okay. not enough ground beef to feed 4 people.
not much flavor. fish was nice and crispy though. an avocado crema would be better then the salsa
Add this one again soon... very healthy and extremely tasty!
Loved the spice on the pitas. Not enough feta / too many chickpeas for my taste. Glad I tried it though!
This was really really bad. After weeks of Chefs plate this is our least favourite meal
We added shredded cheddar and it was fantastic!
I did not enjoy the biscuits and the chicken didn’t seem to turn out right
Potatoes were a little bland
My only complaint is that the avocado was hard as a rock and I had to go buy a ripe one so delayed the recipe by a night.
Burgers were amazing but didn't love the olives on the potatoes

The tortillas detracted from this dish as they tasted stale. I ended up tossing them and using tortilla chips I had in my pantry. Smaller was much better.
"I enjoyed this very much, butmoar cheese and tomatoes! ??"
"Tout simplement délicieux! Le poisson est croustillant, et le reste parfaitement assaisonné! Un coup de coeur!"
I found it a bit too salty because of the feta and capers.
tres bon!
Very tasty. Excellent portions.
Really good and easy to make!
a salad would be nice with it
"Easy to make, great flavours!"
Great flavour!
Maple Glaze was too salty
love all of it except the cabbage. would be great if you’d send it shredded as it doesn’t shred well into small pieces with the odd sized chunk that gets sent
Excellent taste and easy to cook
crispy wontons are the perfect crunch to this rice bowl!
liked the tahini sauce. Had to us my own zahtar and in a larger quantity to add extra flavour to the typically bland basa. Didn’t care for the flavour of your za’atar
"The instructions were a bit confusing, if you only wanted to make half it said to use all the teriyaki sauce, so did you need more sauce to double it or not? Plus, mine arrived without the meat."
Delicious
"great meal, ricotta was a nice addition"
was good but not a fan of Kale...would appreciate if you offered a sub to spinach. Also was disappointed that it wasn't fresh pasta like I'm used to getting with my orders.
pls bring this one back! so yummy
Chicken instructions were confusing. Biscuits didn’t work out.
Tasty but slightly boring
Excellent! Il ne manque qu'un peu de fromage ;)
"Chicken did not look very appetizing, but tasted good,"
"My meat was spoiled, so I had to get chicken from the grocery store to make this. The recipe was bland and boring. The biscuit mix was extremely sticky and almost impossible to use. I would not recommend this recipe."
The recipe failed to state that the pork chop were butterflied.
"Burgers were quite good, although the tomato had gone bad before we made the meal and the sweet potatoes were only alright."
"I liked the ""burger"" part but the sauce wasnt very good and the salad needed something more."
"The chicken was very fatty, the biscuits did not rise, and the salad dressing was very disappointing."
My picky oldest son has something new to eat. He really enjoyed the Basa and the millet (plain with lemon)
Bland
pretty solid. I wasn’t sure what to expect
solid hits the spot. Would have been nice with cheese.
Delicious!
"A 9 oz steak for two people is not a very big serving at all. The steak was excellent, but small. There should have been more green beans too. I was only full because of the potatoes."
Broccoli and tabbouleh were awful! Dinner was a huge let down. Most got thrown out.
Only got 3 chicken for a family of 4 and it did not chrusp up like expected but still delicious
Delicious. Should have probably come with a warning on how spicy it would be. Also I received only one can of beans but should have been two. Fortunately I had a can.
chicken was tasty coleslaw was not cabbage was really bitter
The butterflied pork chops cook unevenly. A simple chop would be better. The dressing was not spectacular. The potatoes weren’t bad.
Really liked this one. Very tasty.
Chicken was very poor quality.
no milk was provided (we don't carry milk in our house). chicken was really fatty
"Weak on value. Missing a few veggies, avocados, cheese, etc."
the biscuits were not very tasty
Then biscuits and coleslaw were good but the chicken never got crispy the way it is in the picture. It was mushy and I couldn’t eat it.
great !
A bit salty
very tasty
Pork chops were GREAT; potatoes and salad were really bad.
enjoyed this one.... portions was a bit small
this was our favorite this week... more please!
Very yummy!
"Tasteless, chewy, veg not fresh"
Family loved the chicken (one of the best!) and biscuits but did not enjoy the coleslaw at all.
You guys send me ketchup but assume I have milk?
Forgot the dijon in the bag. That doesn't usually happen.
"This went above expectations, highly recommend"
loved this
Steak was satisfactory quality.
"really easy to make just don’t whisk the dough , use a spoon or mixer."
the potatoes didn't cook fully and parts of it were still raw
very good!
mint was very odd in the recipe.
absolutely DELISH!!
Such a tasty recipe! I'll make this again and again
Not my favourite - the steak was tougher than it should have been in my mind - and the broccoli didn't cook enough in the time they stated
Just needed some extra Soy
Yummy and very easy to make!
DELICIOUS!!!!
"it was a little bland, still very good. Wish it had a little bit more of a kick, maybe more curry?"
Chicken was amazing but biscuits were not to my taste.
"The pork and salad dressing were great, but the potatoes tasted and smelt like plastic. Even after cooking the with cheese they tasted terrible."
A bit bland. I kept adding pepper at the dinner table.
The steak was perfect and I liked the potatoes. Thanks!
Burgers were delicious the ceasar style potatoes not so much
Chili sauce was super spicy - omitted it and still tasted great
"Fast, simple and super tasty - perfect for busy week night."
Broccoli and tomatoes were good.
its something about the fish....I guess I like my fish for fishy.
fish was totally mushy - even after pan frying - uneatable
this was better served cut up as a bowl dish instead of pieced together on a plate
"The biscuits were especially exceptional, so easy and tasty. The chicken was good but not very photogenic (not crisped). There were coleslaw left over for us, probably didn't need that much."
Delicious dish and the flavors went very well together. I would order this dish again!
tabbouleh was quite bland
"Delicious, very favour full and light."
"We didn’t find there was enough potatoes for two servings, we only had one potato."
didn't care for the spice [Za'atar] still like my dill and tarter sauce
un des meilleurs plats à date!
I added red pepper and mushrooms. I feel it just needs more vegetables.
Amazing dish!
Very bland
I liked the taste of this dish but wish there was a little more sauce as it was just slightly dry. The fresh pasta was AMAZING!
"Chicken was not crispy.....more wet and gooey outside. Recipe should read to dip the chicken in the buttermilk, then dip in coating. Recipe said to mix the 2 together."
"It was a very interesting recipe. Still a bit on the fence about the nutritional yeast, a sort of tangy aftertaste. Glad we tried it but would like to be aware ahead it was vegan."
delicious - everyone enjoyed all of this.
Way too much coleslaw and not enough chicken
Too much lemon
Sauce could be better
Loved this! Will make my own version of it again.
The potatoes were a poor quality and we had to through them out. Steak and preparation were excellent.
"Chicken and biscuits were great, slaw was just ok"
Good. I thought a nicer bun would’ve made the difference for this recipe.
Surprisingly bland
A bit of gravy would have been perfect :)
"The ricotta sauce was a distraction, made the potatoes soggy."
Didn't get to eat them . Shipment didn't come until Friday all the food smelt rotten . Pissed
Didn't get to eat them . Shipment didn't come until Friday all the food smelt rotten . Pissed
Really enjoyed it - better than expected ??
Wanton crisps were ok but the rest was great!
Yucky
Salad was terrible and bitter. Could not even eat it. Otherwise the chicken and biscuits were okay.
Delicious
So good! We cooked the steaks on the BBQ instead of in the oven since we love using the BBQ
"Like the chicken and biscuits but salad was a little too saucy and had too much zing. Also, there was no milk in the bag"
They were kind of mushy.
one of my favourites. wish it came with a side taco though
A pretty boring dish. Real spring rolls would have been a lot better with the cabbage and carrots cooked.
"Lovely flavours, not too spicy, just right."
The wonton crisps are very meh and don't add anything other than texture
Great flavours with this one!
It was hard to get the breading to actually stay on the chicken.
Very disappointed that the pasta was no longer fresh.
Amazing
Rice was still a bit firm but overall it was delicious!
Good idea instead of tortilla chips.
Cooking directions for rice is not good
steak was very good although portions seemed smaller this time beans were very good roasted and the sauce was ok (not great but not bad) I didn’t make the potatoes as I’ll save them for another night - I had my own homemade risotto instead
"Rice was hard and tasted ""fake"" as it was prebroiled. Not enough for 4 servings."
We’ve noticed an improvement in the steak over the past few months. It’s more tender.
Okay. The pita stuck to the dampened paper towel and the flavour was okay.
as expactation.
Very tasty
Recipe instructions for breading the chicken were incorrect and lead to inconsistent results and flavorless chicken
"This did not work well with chicken thighs. The flavours were nice, but would have been so much better with white meat rather than the thighs. The biscuits were easy to make and tasty."
Awful. Instructions missing on card and end product was not good.
Too Many SimilarFlavors
Potatoes were under-cooked for a 15 minute meal. Otherwise was fine for a basic meal.
"The potatoes didn't cook thoroughly, even with a reasonable additional cook time. They were black on the inside and inedible."
Chicken was good. The biscuits were not tasty. We didn't eat them all. We found the salad dressing not to our liking.
Tasty! Next time I wouldn't add the as much dressing to the potatoes.
"Chicken, cous cous and hummus was very good, but garlic sauce was too strong."
the yogurt feta sauce was delicious!
tasty
very tasty
Great blend of texture and taste
Taste was great but had to throw away a few green beans that were past their prime.
Biscuits did not turn out.
Flavourful but not enough sweet potatoes and my seasoning back was missing from my order so I had to recreate out of my own spices
"potatoes were labelled as boiled so we didn't boil them more but baked them in the oven as instructed. Only 1/3 of the potatoes were boiled, despite baking them in the oven so we tossed them aside."
I think there was a mistake in this recipe . Instructions seem to say to add the breadcrumb mixture into the bowl with the buttermilk which was very confusing.
Bland.
"Once again, a very delicious meal!!!"
This was delicious! I avoid gluten so made the orzo for my husband and used half the ingredients and made quinoa for me. Con: too many dishes were required to put it together.
I found this very bland.
"Bun was too big, also the tomatoes were hard to keep on the burger"
amazing!!
More meat and veg and less pasta
"There was no fish sent to me, I had to buy it separately."
Chicken and beans were very tasty but the potatoes were not very flavourful.
potatoes a bit bland but overall tasty meal
the cottage cheese added nice flavour boost!
this was probably one of the worst meals we’ve had from chefs plate. the chicken took longer than 15 min to cook and it wasn’t golden and crispy. also the meat was quite fatty and the pieces were quite small. if this was on the menu again I would definitely not order.
"this was supposed to be a two person portion, however it only came with one steak. one steak, 2 potatoes and a handful of green beans is not enough for two portions. the steak had a weird texture as well."
The chicken was excellent. We were not as fond of the orzo side.
"Chicken was soggy, didn't crisp up and I don't know why. Also didn't realize I needed milk until I started the recipe. I don't keep milk in the house so it was a pain to have to go out and get it."
"good, I replaced the green peppers and added cheese and avocados"
a little bland but not bad I would have liked rice or more naan
delicious
Could use a little cheese
not enough steak
Delicious
not enough flour for the fried chicken
the “fried” chicken did not turn out anything close to the picture. it was pale and greasy and zero crispyness
Great blend of flavours! My fav this week!
Super easy and quiteenjoyable.
"rice was a bit mushy but the beef, vegetables and sauce made up for it"
La sauce est trop salée.
It was excellent. I think it was one of the best meals that we have had. 5 stars
The fish turned out really nice!
"Super acidic using all the lemon + tomatoes. It was still really tasty, loved the super garlic!"
this was more about personal preference for me. im not a big fan of sausage type meats. my partner enjoyed it very much!
Easy and delicious!
"Tasty fish, slightly small portions."
Was very excited to make this box on the second night but the green beans and kitchen had both spoiled
The feta just melted and didn't stay in cubes as expected. flavourful.
"Not creamy enough, but otherwise ok."
the fries were soooo good! burger was tasty too
We follow the directions and yet 'crispy' always end up almost soggy.
I wonder if those were GMO potatoes
Yummy
"potatoes were brown, very low value meal. also an ingredient was missing"
I thought it was bland.
Lovely meal. Took less time than the recipe suggested to crisp the tostadas... but they were yummy!
Excellent value for each plate!

Love the crunch of the cabbage and the creaminess of the avocado salsa. I didn’t use the mayonnaise (because I hate it) but the slaw turned out spectacularly without it.
The raw chicken was covered in chunks of fat and was completely butchered into several random pieces. very disappointing chicken and the coleslaw was grainy and went into the garbage.
"Very tasty,"
Delicious! Great serving size and very easy to prepare
not really spicy at all
chilli garlic sauce was too spicy for us
"The chicken spice mix was too peppery and we didn’t enjoy it the biscuits were dry, but that could have been our fault."
good but the avocado was no ripped and there was missing an ingredient. Never had issues like this before
The chicken was awful...
Sauce was difficult and sticky. Assumed potatoes needed oil as all other recipes include it?
BEST FISH TACOS TO DATE!! And we've been LONG time customers. Definitely a re-make!
I enjoyed this one. Never knew how to make cous cous but now I do!

All your pasta recipes are the best. Never had pasta so fresh and so delicious.
Kids even ate double their usual amount.
very juicy
"flavours were good, but the chicken thighs were not great quality, and the biscuits too runny (made something more like pancakes than biscuits)."
"buns were flat, recipe unclear, breeding fell off the chicken"
Manque de sauce
Delicious! I recommend using less of the sauce on the sweet potatoes or even leaving it on the side to dip instead!
This was very flavorful
The green beans were overcooked using the directions provided.
Delicious and easy to make
this meal was awesome. the combo lunch/dinners was why I have chefs plate a try (I’ve gotten good food evey week for over a year. loved simplicity of recipes and the lunch option!
I order this every time I see it on the menu it is a definite favorite!
"Biscuits outstanding, Chicken very juicy and tasty, Coleslaw is just Ok"
Very good!
Was good but one bell pepper was rotten and had while in it

"I added a bit more garlic and some dried hot peppers, yum!"
Potatoes always take longer in these 15 min recipes than what it says
Taste was amazing. I made the recipe incorrectly because of the description of how to bread the chicken. I ended up mixing the breading with the milk. I was supposed to use a different shallow dish for the breading. Wish the recipe said that. Very confusing.
"I sent an email about it already, but it was pretty flavorless, and the greens had gone bad and were Brown and quite slimy."
loved this!
recipe required milk that was not provided. Many people do not drink/buy milk anymore.
omg. so easy and something wouldn't to think to make on my own. would order this again and again
Very Tasty I really liked it.
"Lacking flavour, more ingredients needed"
"didnt like the beef, but sauce and idea of dish was good"
So good! Loved the strong garlic flavor!
"chicken had lots of fat and tough bits, and the crust wasn't... crusty :("
this was amazing! surprisingly great combo!
"Didnt like the spices on the potatos, very bland. Had to use my own chicken as the package was open. Otherwise the flavour was good and green beans were good."
Kids loved it. I'm not a big fan of brown rice. At least this had a sauce though to make it more palatable.
"Was good but if we ever made it next time i would only put a littlenofnthe sauce on, as it was very strong. white fish doesnt have much flavor sonthe sauce made up for that. had to cook fish longer than indicated, and it fell apart pretty easily."
"My chicken breading was a failure. I don't know if it was me or the recipe, but I didn't end up with nearly enough breading to create a nice, crunchy coat on the chicken."
Too much pasta this time which is a surprise as there usually is just enough.
The recipe said to save some of the pasta water but did not say what to do with it .... confusing!
Delicious!
Potatoes had gone bad
potatoes were undercooked even with extra time. steak was good but not much in the way of peppercorn coating. also not the greatest cut of meat.
Potato gratin would have turned out better if baked with the cheese sauce first before broiling to crisp the topping. Pork chops could have used more seasoning.
Good flavour combination
2 small tacos with no side dish was not enough food. The avocado was rock hard.
the steak was great
Outstanding!! Loved it..
I think this is our favourite so far!!!
good but not enough vegetarian protein
Food temperature was a bit of an issue; however did enjoy.
Recipe forgot to mention that the potatoes need to be tossed in a drizzle of oil before roasting.
Too spicy for me but good
"Burgers came out juicy and buns were fresh. loved the caesar dressing. Only complaint is everything tasted the same, need a little more variety."
this was a tasty and very easy to make meal
so delicious and nutritious !!
Delicious!
"Chicken just burnt because it was super fatty. Also, the mixture on the chickens didn’t stick well (too watery). Not impressed at all"
Excellent recipe. I think that you should provide the buttermilk as you did before.
the cauliflower was very stinky and the sauce was not good at all
"We have noticed anytime we order beef (steak-type, not ground) the quality of the meat makes its so touch that it’s almost inedible we won’t be ordering any of these type of beef dishes again"
great flavor!
Delicious! More spice needed though. :)
this was super gross. could not eat it
"So far the WORST DISH. takes a lot longer than 15 min, the ingredients were not fresh and the flavours didn’t go well."
"Burgers were tasty, but the potatoes would've been better crispy instead of turning them soggy with the olives and liquids."
don’t advertise chicken breasts and send thighs
yummy!!!!
"If I could put zero stars this would be. Chicken was grey brown, biscuits didn't rise."
Basa was tough and not easy to work with. The rest of the recipe was delicious.
we really like this one! lots of flavour.
really liked the textures in this meal!
This was very tasty but I am sick of green beans.
loved last nights meal
Great dinner! The tahini dressing was delicious on both the fish and the tabbouleh!
This was the best steak we have ever received
"Sauce did not mix well, was very thick, might of been expired."
The chicken was delicious. The biscuits did not turn out well with the homemade buttermilk (as compared to when buttermilk is provided). We also didn't care for the salad.
"The breading process did not result in my chicken looking like the picture. It turned out to be a gloopy mess. Also, the way the meat is packaged is very messy. I"
I liked it.
Olives added a delicious flavour to the potatoes.
good! would have preferred white meat instead of thighs
"juicy burgers and delicious , maybe a tad too much mustard in the dressing but that's simply a preference of our family"
Everything was really good with this meal. I would order this one again
I was not able to cut the squash that came with this meal however it did turn out well
potatoes remained uncooked after 30 minutes. extremely uninteresting meal.
not really good.. and i love noodles :(
Just a bit of arugula would have added to the tomato topping :)
Really tasty! Abit hot for me. Next time I'll adjust the heat. :)
awesome!
"A tad too heavy on the garlic side for me, otherwise delicious!"
"Excellent! Easy to make and very tasty, will order again!"
Our favourite so far
Repeat recipe. Please send fresh noodles again...
weird flavour..and kind of bland
comfort food at it's best - easy to make and full of flavour. A keeper recipe!

I know we are off to a tough start. Just OK. Too much spice.
Never received
"The tacos were delicious! The wraps could have been bigger, it got messy trying to fit the fish,salsa and slaw into the small wrap."
"excellent dish , easy to cook , chicken portions were on the small size , saying this though we are big eaters ..."
Tasty and so easy to make with all the right ingredients. Will be repeating this one for sure! Thanks.
Delicious
Why would you put salad dressing on a perfectly good pork chop?
decent. a bit salty on the chicken seasoning.
It tasted like random flavours thrown together without balance.
The hot sauce was too hot but the dish was a little bland without it. Still enjoyed it though.

"Great flavour, consider adding chick peas or chicken"
"need more beans than potatoes, glaze was a little too salty"
not awesome
Keep up the good work by making my work so much easier and so much more fun. Meals are a joy to prepare and delicious to eat. I 'specially like being able to share the meals with 1-2-3 friends .
I didn't actually get the pork to make this recipe so I improvised and used the turkey I was sent instead and made just the dinner - it was delicious
Did not try the avocado salsa as the avocado was not ripe.
"Really nice comfort food - if I were to make it again, I would sautee the garlic with the mushrooms as I didn't enjoy the bite of almost raw garlic in the dish. Loved the addition of wild mushrooms!"
just like in a restaurant! Loved the sauce.
Loved the ingredients and the noodles are always fresh!
Did not enjoy this one
"i love the dinner and lunch combos! this is a nice tasty twist to the normal sloppy joes/chili! carrot fries were soggy, which i dont mind personally."
very good. Add shredded cheese and it's a great poutine!
We REALLY did not like anything about this dish!!! It was our first time having Basa and we did not like it at all! The tahini curdled when the lemon was added. Bad seasoning. Almost inedible.
one of the best plates we've had. We didn't use the plum sauce as that would have made it too sweet - but we added the ginger to the cabbage and it was amazing!
simple glaze recipe was good for chicken
The sauce was a bit too sweet and the meat could have been cut smaller. Next time I will know to cut the meat up a bit more than how it comes.
a bit dry at the end but tasty
Easy to make and great flavors!
Phenomenal!
Did not receive the milk in the package. Receipe was difficult to follow almost like some instructions were missing. Biscuits were like pancakes.
Don't like the teriyaki source
The mustard tastes a bit bitter
needs some spicy
"kind of bland, lacked flavour"
Flavours were fantastic.. keep it up!
Loved it!! Especially the fish
Just okay
"Chicken and Biscuits were good, salad a bit bitter / strong onion taste"
the steak was so delicious! and so easy!
a sauce on top would have been good too
"No lemon or cucumber were included in my box, so it was not possible to enjoy this meal"
"Super tasty! I used the chicken pan to cook the veggies, and that worked very well (and reduced the dishes). My only complaint is that you've stopped including butter in the packages. :/"
Very easy to make which was nice but not worth the price.
Great meal
DELICIOUS!! The miki noodles are my favourite
Always love your burgers the most. I particularly liked the focaccia buns for these turkey burgers.
super easy to make and really tasty!
AMAZING!!!!
Loved the flavours
"pita might have been nicer if it was crisped in the oven, instead of headed in foil"
no milk provided for the biscuits and chicken was kind of fatty and bland
The sauce was not good and the steak was tough.
Not bad. Healthy choice
not enough steak for 2 people
"Beans were chewy, but we enjoyed the chicken and potatoes."
Everyone loved it.
really boring!
Please bring more meals like this:)
great sauce
"This meal was good , but to many mushrooms for the kids."
Flavours are good. Potatoes were not precooked enough.
"Was very tasty, but the cauliflower we received was rotten"
Delicious!
"The avocado was rock hard. I had to buy one that was soft enough. Otherwise, very tasty"
"Yummy! Could have cooked a bit more, I think. Looks nothing like your picture BTW."
too much kale in relation to pasta and not enough tomato sauce.
we loved this meal!!! sooooo easy and so delicious! in love with chefs plate.
"After using chefs plate for over a year, this was our favorite so far so easy but so much flavor!"
Not much flavour
It could have used more spice - more sriracha sauce.
"a little light on the tomatoes, could use double what was included"
"this unfortunately was disappointing. Too many toppings, not enough sweet potato. An it as barely enough for the 2 of us for dinner"
Did not like. Had a sour taste.
I didn't like the biscuits. Chicken was great.
so delicious and creative !
spicy but delicious and not too heavy. Nice veggie option.

"Could have made this on my own, more uniqueness and different ingredients"
"I didn't know I needed milk for this recipe and that we are now needing milk to have on hand. It would be cool if when selecting a specific recipe, you rec'd a heads up about extra items needed."
the chicken was poor quality

Amazing
"The potatoes were awful. The cooking instructions (3-5 minutes under broiler) kept the ""quick"" potatoes partially raw."
Such a great meal that I wouldn't normally cook!
Basil that was included.....was spoiled and not usable ar all!!!
Spice was great.
This instantly became one of my all-time CP faves: so much flavour in the chicken spice mix and pickles (you can never go wrong with pickles)!
I had to discard one of the potatoes and some of the tomatoes as they were rotten . Disappointing
This was excellent.
Meredith is the coolest!
Great except the wine went down the sink and we used real wine.
This didnt turn out as I expected
"Chicken portion was too small, but it was tasty"
"Fish tacos where very tasty, but I felt it wasn't enough. 3 taco shells didn't seem enough for the amount of stuffing. I found cutting the fish difficult, I don't know why."
this was good but not a complete meal. I made a side salad myself
I wasn't trusting of the fish...second suspect fish dish in two weeks from Chef's plate
tastes great but doesn’t look at all appealing when cooked at home :(
loved this so much but would have been great to have something more than just greens for the salad even dressing would have been nice
Not a fan of nutritional yeast. It overpowered any curry flavour.
didn’t receive my fish!
Couldn't seem to get the carrots crispy.
step 3 was very confusing and it messed up the chicken
I’ve had a few turkey burger meals from chefs plate and they are so yummy.
Chicken was over cooked
flavours were excellent. I would use a less delicate fish if I were to do it again. millet is also soft so I felt it needed a sturdier fish. Again flavours amazing and easy prep.
"The fish never got firm it was soggy and didn’t have Fish texture it was mushy , we didn’t care for the tabbouleh salad ... I can honestly say this is the first one none of us liked at all !"
cucumbers were soft and rotten
Instructions were a little vague. Needed to explain in more detail certain steps but delicious.
Missing the cauliflower so couldn’t prepare. I would give this a zero if I could. So disappointed
Another huge hit in our house. a simple and common dish but my little girls loved helping to make it and my picky eating 5 y/o ate her entire plate and asked for more.
This was a FANTASTIC meal - we were both still dreaming about the garlic sauce the next day! Will make this one ourselves for sure!
You forgot to send the biscuit mix! We were looking forward to it.
"I recommend Chefs Plate to everyone and we have enjoyed the meals so much! I was disappointed with this recipe. First, I don’t consider milk a staple and it should have been included in the recipe. Second, we were sent 3 chicken thighs... why not four!? Also - the chicken breading was so strange - more of a batter and it was very difficult to coat the entire chicken pieces as it just clumped together - maybe should have dipped the chicken in the coating instead of adding it to the chicken...? the batter also stuck to the cookie sheet even though I put lots of oil on it :/ my oven was also covered in oil splatters by the end of it :( overall, a tasty meal but execution could use some work!"
Needed more sauce!
Loved it...might be too spicy for some tho...
"I followed all the instructions, but the chicken was barely coated, it burned onto my best baking sheet, and most of the coating slouched off while I pried ot from the sheet. Also it smoked terribly. I hate to complain but it was not a hit here and I haven’t even tried cleaning my baking sheet yet."
"A burger is all about the bun! Can we get ""fancier"" buns? Not bigger, just fluffier (think: Cobs Bread type)"
why did the kale smell so badly?!
SHOCKINGLY GOOD!! One of our faves!
Incredibly easy to make and super delicious!
"Poisson pâteux, texture très décevante"
delicious
"Not very flavourful, would have been better with more ingredients."
"delicious,"
"Everything was great, except the salad. It had way too much mustard in it and was disgusting."
"nice quickly, easy meal!"
"Not very saucy or cheesy, kind of dry and boring"
The Dijon and cabbage were too bitter .. the buttermilk biscuits tasted good but fell flat. Recipe didn't work for us but mostly tasted good except for the slaw.
favorite with all
Needs some extra pickled beets or something
"This was disappointing. The chicken was not crispy at all, due to batter not being able to crisp up. Was so excited for this dish, but it was just a let down."
"likely worst CP meal in 2 years.meat was small portion and low quality and did not cook like the photo showed.Directions were confusing,should have been rated at least 2 star and needed own milk?! Etc"
"Spice mix was missing, so burgers didn't form properly. Had to add my own spices, it turned out okay. I put the salad inside the pita with the quinoa mixture and just made it into a wrap."
Brussel sprouts with the leeks and sauce tasted great
The meal needed a salad. It seemed lacking more vegetables . I wish I had added spinach for more nutrition.
kinda bland. was looking forward to a real beef & broccoli taste instead of a muted lime teriyaki
Best meal I've had in awhile!
Great taste and quick to make. Worth remaking.
This was good but found the amount of red wine used with the meal was very strong and I did not enjoy as much as I wanted
nothing special. overpriced for what it was.
beans were soft/going off.
Beans were not very fresh at all
Flavor was good but needed some protein - chickpeas?
very good
"great flavor, so easy to make."
Good but avocado was not ripe and was 3rd meal I made !
"Good quality - bit messy, hard to fry all tortillas proper."
"My said, ""If we got this in a restaurant we'd never go there again. Yuck."
"I'm not familiar with this dish, but it tasted good. I think it could have used some more vegetables."
"Quite good, served it over rice."
"this was an excellent dish , perfect size for two healthy appetites,"
Very Good

chicken was difficult to bread
Too much rice for our liking . Rest was great
"I liked the chicken, but the green beans came out kind of soggy."
Ginger in the plastic bag is a nightmare to get out
The flavour was incredible. Loved it!
Dukkah seasoning is one of my favourites.
No flavour. I added extra curry and salt and it still tasted bland.
Getting the batter to stick was tricky. Still very tasty. The slaw was a little bitter (maybe the mustard?)
I love that the nutritional yeast replaces real cheese in this making the dish vegan. It was SO GOOD.
Amazing.
Absolutely delicious! My husband is a meat and potatoes kind of guy and this meal was perfect for him! Super delicious and super quick and easy to make!
This was was just OK... I really liked the coleslaw/salsa but the fish was meh
It was delicious.
Could have used a salad? Or lettuce on the burger
No one liked this. We threw it out.
Fantastic one of my favourites so far
Very tasty and crispy!
Fish was overpowering the spices
Almost too spicy.
Easy to make and really tasty!
Very easy and tasty
"beef was disgusting, tasted raw even while cooked; the ricotta dressing did not complement dish; green bean were tough."
Avocado was not ripe.
"I would make this once a week and make it a staple just mix up turkey, chicken, sausage and steak. a great tasting recipe."
"This is the first meal I have prepared from Chef’s Plate, it was very easy, quick and, delicious! I would get this one again."
"Thought it was a chicken recipe, my mistake"
great
"there were a lot of issues with this recipe. the flavours were odd, the breading didn’t stick to the chicken and the chicken was grossly undercooked."
Chicken was great but I'm not a huge fan of these unhealthy mayo-infused salads... keep salads healthy! They don't need mayo!
super good! one bag of kale would have sufficed though
"The cilantro was half rotten. Very good otherwise, more one pot meals please!"
This dish should be a monthly reoccurrence
It's our favorite
potatoes were disgusting
Amazing!
Not as saucy as we’d like - we added a little extra sauce. Yummy!
The biscuits did not work out. They were very flat. The breading on the chicken while tasty was slimy and not crispy.
"Not great, requires milk which we do not have. Breading on chicken was mushy and unappetizing. Meat was good."
This was delicious - but hardly seemed worth the price.
Fantastic! Loved the yeast trick!
Pork was good. Pre-cooked potatoes were hard. Gratin was just milk on potatoes. Too many creamy elements with Kale salad.
Wonderful and delicious!
Amazing! Loved the garlic sauce (all 4 kids did too). The pickles on the side were a nice touch! The hummus was delicious. Loved all the components and only 15 minutes.
good for the mushroom lover
Good but very simple and not enough flavor
Did not enjoy cooking or eating this. The 1 lemon I received wasn't big enough to have enough juice to make a proper sauce with the tahini and I didn't like the broccoli with the other flavours.
More veggies
Tasty and easy kids liked it too
Loved the idea. Giant portions. A little dry.
it’s a bit bland once everything is made - maybe include more curry paste and powder
Dijon was too spicy - or too much for the coleslaw
it was very good!
could be alittle crisper outside batter
They were delicious but hard to eat
easily my favourite meal to date
"WAAAYYYYYY to spicy to be a family pleaser. My kids were choking on the spicy chicken coating, no warning at all. And I just threw the dijon mustard in the garbage and made my own coleslaw dressing."
"keep an eye on the “nachos” while they’re in the oven: they might need less time, depending on your oven!"
This was surprisingly good. I didn't have high expectations. Only call out is the quick potato gratin was a little too quick. 10 Minutes in my broiler and the potato was still cold.
Very tasty.
Simple and tasty!
Really enjoyed this recipe however there was way too much green onion provided. We used less than half
"fantastic, everything about this meal was delicious. quinoa needed a bit longer cooking time than indicated, also for the sweet potatoes - probably double the time"
"The applewood spice made the chicken soooo tasty. I would give it 5stars but the green beans were small, brown, wilty and actually some of them were slimy. I took a picture and will email it to you."
We were really disappointed with this meal. It just tasted...bad. We could have easily ordered Chinese food for cheaper than this meal cost and actually have enjoyed it.
Absolutely fantastic. The entire family enjoyed this one!
the whole family love it .
very flavourful and great portion size
We had to replace the onions and peppers as they had turned to mush in the packaging and didn't look healthy. Once we put our own fresh ingredients in the meal was good.
I did not get to add the basil because it parished quickly and was unusable by the third day
The broccoli was already chopped up and it went bad in two days. Had to buy more broccoli to use in recipe
"Very little protein, but tasty. Again, not great value in terms of ingredients. Appreciated low gluten if naan was tossed, which it was."
Why was the milk not included in the ingredients? Thought that was odd. I was lucky I had some cream (not milk) in my fridge at the time as I typically do not have milk in the house.
Hefty with potatoes and bread...perhaps salad instead
Yummy! But a bit too much lime!
Family favourite!
Recipe was great but the lime was not in good shape so couldn’t zest the lime as per recipe.
This was soooo delicious. I could eat that garlic sauce all day.
Small portion
Not very filling for my 24 ur old son. Not my favorite recipe.
I don’t even like Mexican food and this was my favourite dish I ever had from chefs plate
I would adjust the recipe card to allow for more time for the precooked potatoes. It said to go straight to broiler - ideally maybe boil for 2 mins and then to broiler?
wasn’t a fan of the type of steak and potatoes
Amazing. Loved the beans.
Oops can't undo - haven't tried yet
Can’t remember if it’s was a 15 minute meal but I do find the potatoes provided are usually undercooked
Amazing! So much flavour!
The chicken and glaze was great! But the potatoes were very dry. Doesn’t seem the instructions said to toss in oil or anything?
"again = very tasty - we however like lots of sauce, so my husband particularly would have enjoyed more sauce."
Yum
yum
It is too much spicy
"Loved, loved loved the peanut sauce"
Didn’t do the potatoes with olives cause ... nope. Did make a mayo garlics dip and added olive mixture which was tasty for me and hubby who didn’t like olives didn’t have to use. Burgers too big.
Great flavor for chicken and beans but the potatoes were a little flavorless.
Steak good. Beans rotten.
"Of the three recipes this was my favourite! Even one of my kids ate the coleslaw, so that was awesome. These recipes are getting my kids involved in preparing the meals and try ew things!"
"Quick, easy, one that I will try to replicate again."
loved it!
Very tasty. I did bake the sweet potatoes longer in order to get them softer.
Chicken and biscuits amazing. Coleslaw left something to be desired.
Loved them.
"Not awful, not fantastic. It was filling though."
Great! But almost a bit too spicy. Such good flavour
Steak was tough to chew
Flavourful and balanced with the right amount of vegetables

"I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I expected it to be simple, but the the flavor was incredible and the vinegrette really brought everything together nicely."
The leeks and Brussels sprouts were a little too much for my taste.
Yum!
the noodles are overpowering.
Tasty but a bit high cal/low protein for my new requirements
"it was quite dry, needed more cheese or sauce"
pairing such a heavy salad with a burger is a bad choice. the burger is heavy and calls for something much lighter on the side. Also the cesar dressing (the garlic) on the salad overpowers the burger..making the burger taste bland
I thought I was ordering chicken breasts. It was good but my partner prefers breasts to thighs.
delicious!
"Not crazy about the dressing. Some of the potatoes pieces were not cooked enough. The chops and potatoes flavour was very good and the meal was able to be prepared quickly, so that was nice."
"salad was outstanding, great dressing! The burgers were just ok."
"really yummy, easy to make"
Really good but was still hungry.
The tahini sauce didn’t work too thick
Biscuits were disappointing. Not a good taste.
Coleslaw was gross and “whisking” the biscuit mix just got it caught in the whisk!
Chicken was so tender and the tasty!
Turned out to be my least favourite since I started last year. It was just ok..... maybe because it has been up against some amazing competition from all the meals over the past year :)
Good !
This one didn’t really crisp up. Taste was good but the texture was a bit soft.
The feta cheese sauce was amazing!
Excellent taste and our favorite meal of the week.
Garlic sauce was AMAZING!
the sweet potatoe salad was one of my favourite things I have eaten from Chef’s Plate
Good flavour but frying everything is a bit messy and the tomatoes were a bit over ripe when we got the box.
very good!
Easy and delicious
I was still hungry after the meal.
i couldn't tell if the fish was cooked or not.
"Large carrot again but as usual, your meat is very tender."
Would eat this every week!
good quality meat was included for this meal.
the green beans were slimey and could not be used for the dinner. the steak was very flavourful
Would be better with fresh pasta as in the past
"very good, but overcooked the wontons"
fresh pasta pleaaase :)
Nacho dish using sweet potatoes instead of chips...works for me! I added some Jalapeno peppers to give it some kick...great dish.
Love these. Fresh & bright. Breading the fish was very easy to do.
Makes enough for 3
just not good!
Fantastic recipe; easy and delicious!!
would like to see a meat version of this meal
Never had tabbouleh. Enjoyed it greatly. Fish was very fresh.
This was quick simple and tasty!
"the potatoes were uncooked even after cooking them in the oven for 15mins before putting on the”cheese sauce, which needed more cheese,a cup full grated). The pork chops were very salty. If you had a zero star notation I would have used it. in addition to precooking the grey potatoes, I had to put them in the microwave for a further 10 minutes!!! The meal was a disaster !"
amazing
Coleslaw was oversauced & instructions for breading needed more detail
The stems of the kale should be removed. They are tough and not nice to eat. I picked them all out.
Rice was too mushy
Beans were inedible.
I made this into a soup it was great
The pre made rice didn’t taste very appetizing - tasted fake
Biscuits were something new. Very flavourful.
Milk was not included. We do not drink milk and did not have any at the time we were making the recipe. Last week butter was not included in a recipe. Not ok.
love the recipes - hate the new recipe cards
Very disappointed that it’s not fresh pasta anymore - probably won’t be ordering much because of that
Great sauce and salad. Chicken spice requires to be marinated otherwise doesn’t taste as it should.
"In 3 years of using Chefs Plate, I have to say that this meal was my favourite! And I’m not even a chicken lover so that’s saying a lot!!! Just WOW! We rate every meal from1-10, this one is 10++"
Kids liked it but for adults it was too plain.
"Très bon, surprenant! Je n'aurais pas eu besoin du pain, comme les croquettes étaient consistantes, mais c'était très bon, je le referai sans doute!"
Why the decision to no longer have fresh pasta? This is disappointing.
Delicious! Great taste 10/10
"The chicken was moist and biscuits were good. The presentation was very 'orange' however, so a green salad would have been much preferred over the slaw."
These were the best thing from the last 2 weeks of meals easily!
It was very good
Like homemade and a lot less fattening than restaurant versions.
"Good combination of flavours, easy to make."
"Chicken batter looked nothing like on the photo, recipe seem to be not well tested"
One of the best recipes yet
i replaced the couscous with rice and that made it great.


The variants on this recipe are always delicious and I'm always happy to get it
very yummy and easy to make!
Whole grain rice would be healthier with this but very yummy as is.
I think my rating has more to do with the meat I received than the recipe per se. it just had a texture that kept me from enjoying he meal fully.
"Chicken good, but biscuit measurements were off. Too much liquid and a surprise that I would have to have milk on hand to complete the recipe."
Steak tasted like a bad old cow
Some of the raw vegetables were less than fresh. Otherwise delicious
Excellent flavour!
This was great alternative to regular mac & cheese especially because one of my sons doesn't eat dairy. Thanks for including this recipe.
You might want to warn people that if you use all of the peppers it will be very hot and provide an option scale as to how much of it they should use if they want it mild medium or hot.
"Chicken and coleslaw were tasty. Biscuits were flat, almost like thick pancakes"
Potatoes were not good
EVERYTHING was delicious about this meal. We loved it all.
Great recipe. Easy to make.
pita would work better or cracked wheats
Potato dish doesnt cook well
This was awesome! I loved every part of it!
So good! I would definitely make this again.
Add a fried egg to the leftovers for a fantastic brunch.
potatoes weren’t cooked enough prior to baking
The Kentucky-style breading was delicious. I'd like to try it on tofu or potatoes. The biscuits were flavourful.
Loved the garlic plum sauce.
Awesome
The flavor felt off and the fish itself was flavorless
"Surprisingly, one the best meals from you ever."
Not a fan of the texture the kale is hard to eat
This tasted fine but in no way took 15 minutes. It was more like 30 and I’m a really experienced cook.
outstandin
"I put it back in the broiler for a minute after putting the black beans and veg on, to melt the second layer of cheese and jazz up those sad winter tomatoes. Pretty sure this step was ESSENTIAL to how good I thought these were. (They did rule though.)"
Again super tiny portions. Not sure if this is meant for adults or children??
Didn't like the sauce
Second time getting this. I absolutely LOVE this dish! Added bonus is that it is plant based.
This was by far my favourite !!!
"I was really looking forward to this recipe however it didn't turn out as we hoped because we were confused with the instructions. We confused the ""buttermilk mixture"" and ""buttermilk biscuit mix."""
my favourite yet!!!
Chicken thighs were fatty. Biscuit was excellent.
Yum!
Very tasty and delicious.
This was a mess. I followed the instructions to pour the coating into the chicken and buttermilk which formed a paste. The coleslaw was very wet.
This was tasty and a generous recipe.
Merveilleux! poulet tendre et délicieux :)
"Again, spoiled meat in my box. This time I couldn’t smell it so I didn’t realize it was bad until I’d already cooked the meal and took a bite. Had to go to the store and buy two new steaks. Very frustrating. Anyway, this recipe was fairly plain - the ricotta cheese/vinegar mixture was a saving grace to add some flavour. Wouldn’t recommend this recipe."
"This was one of the best meals I've had from Chef's Plate. I would absolutely make this meal again, although the couscous needed a little more seasoning."
steak was superb but the potatoes could have been better
"Good, wanted more sauce"
This was an absolute fail with my teens. The biscuits were flat and not fluffy nor tasty. Adult teen ordered pizza instead. It has not been a successful Chefs Plate week and i refer everyone i possibly can! ????
Very nice. Your basa dishes are always good.
Recipe was good but I wish it was a higher quality type of fish than basa
Very good
"The biscuits were flat, the chicken coating didn't really coat and we just weren't fond of a dijon dressing on the slaw."
Yummmmm
Excellent
Loved it!
Garlic sauce is amazing!
Live the hanger steak!! Wish we can have hanger steak every other week!!
chicken was good but coleslaw and biscuit were horrible
Key is to slice red cabbage very finely so dressing can be absorbed.
"Delicious, especially the chicken."
Très bon! Le steak bifteck est tendre et la sauce vient apporter une petite amertume qui équilibre le tout.
Loved the contrast from the tangy salsa and rice.
great bisket
The wording around making the buttermilk and using in other areas later in the recipe was confusing.
"The flavor was great, i may have coated the chicken wrong it was very uneven but still very good!"
this was my favourite meal so far!! so good!
The linguine dish is my new favourite - wish I could have it again and again!
good but not a focvorite
"this was DELICIOUS! I personally would void the siracha next time, but overall it was a really great dish that we both enjoyed"
"This was our favourite dish in the delivery this week, very delicious!"
Simple but yummy
Loved the flavors and all the fresh veggies.
"This was delicious, pleasantly surprised with all the unique flavors"
Delicious. Kid favorite!
My 16 year old son made this meal for us. It was easy for him to make and IT WAS DELICIOUS!
Sauce was not very good at all.
The beef was extremely tough
Buns were sub par.
Very tasty. We enjoyed this meal a lot. Only thing that would have made it better was if it was with fresh pasta.
"Needed some more spice in the burger, or crunchy"
Delish! Everything was amazing. I espeically loved the ricotta green beans.
The patties were bland without the sauce
Delicious! Love the crispy edges!!!
The garlic sauce was delicious.
Delicious.
The potatoes had potential but there wasn't enough sauce to do what I think you were going for. The pork did not turn out well.
The beans and spiciness overwhelmed the taste of the potatoes a little. I would have liked less beans mixture and maybe some avocado and more salsa
This was excellent
"cucumber & salad were soft, but ok"
"The bowl was too dry, the sauce was too thick and sweet."
Simple and delicious dish
not a great flavour
Salad wasn't great.
"green beans were going off, many were mushy."
"Everything was good, except for the spring mix. Majority of the greens were soggy and limp and we were unable to enjoy them with our dinner."
"The meal was quite bland and off putting for my wife and I. We do like the fish, but the rest of the dish didn't taste great at all. This was probably the first dish that my wife and I absolutely hate"
I added more cheese to the top. The time in the broiler wasn't long enough to get the potatoes warm so I microwaved them to have them ready in time.
I need the milk included in the recipes
Bland overall. And the sauce for the carrots/cabbage was excessively spicy.
Meat was poor quality
Not a fan of basa
Tasty but needed lettuce
A little more sauce would be good
"These were very spicy, and tasty."
A fine meal.
Great flavour and lots of leftovers !
The steak was very tender and tasty This was an excellent meal.
love the biscuits
"Very good and tasty, love the recipe. Also love that it is a dinner/lunch combo-this option is so helpful and welcome."
tastey but near portions a little small
good but meat portions a little small
I was not keen on the meal though my husband thought it was very good. I guess it's different taste preferences.
Too much kale
This was one of the most disappointing recipes we have had from chefs plate.

Delicious
Don't like curry
Not enough chicken and cold slaw recipe was terrible
It was good but the potatoes were pretty undercooked for the time recommendation and I cooked them much longer as well.
literally inedible the chicken was grey and the instructions appeared to be wrong (adding the breading to the bowl with the buttermilk and chicken) the breading came out completely soggy the biscuits had an odd texture and taste we couldnt finish it
Very flavorful. The portion was on the smaller side. Would try again
Ricotta sauce was just ok
"This was a really nice surprise- something different, easy to prepare and it tasted good."
Quick and delicious. Loved the garlic and shawarma spices.
This was amazing!
"They were really really good. I'm glad that I use the black beans as a dip rather than putting them on top of the potatoes, just because it was really really spicy."
"Not great. We accidentally over cooked it, did not help"
Kids don’t like mushrooms and there was no dinner left for me! BIG HIT
"The hummus was bland, the pickles seemed unrelated and none of us finished our dinners or wanted this for leftovers."
"Bland, and millet didn’t seem cooked"
Loved the sour cream mixed with cumin!
chicken was thighs and very fatty the slaw had way too much mayo and biscuits came out flat
Chicken wasn't very crisp. Flavours were quite nice.
always a favorite
"Baby greens again were too wilted, on day 2 after delivery!"
The recipes don't include milk now??...really.
Horrible recipe. Very misleading. Biscuits are not biscuits... more like pancakes. And chicken was not crispy at all. Big disappointment. Worse meal from chefsplate
need more cilantro
Surprisingly tastier than expected. Kids enjoyed it too
Easy to make. Great flavours.
Very good and easy to make! My delivery didn't make it on delivery day - it arrived 2 days later - so there was a couple of ingredients that I had to purchase
My delivery didn't arrive delivery day -arrived 2 days later -there was a couple of ingredients that I had to purchase - I didn't use the turkey wasn't sure how it was stored with the delayed delivery
Delicious but quite heavy....high in fat. Some greens would have been good to add for the burger toppings.
I love the pita
omitted some of the sriacha - but super tasty
Mushy potatoes under overly spicy beans mix - fail number 2 with the family.
"too much dressing compared to slaw, not enough breading for amount of chicken. Times were off: chicken needed more time and biscuits needed less."
Nobody liked this one.
nice change from the usual pasta!
the breading fell off the chicken and the final product looked nothing like the picture. the biscuits were good. the coleslaw was too strongly mustard flavored
"the tahini dress had the wrong consistency, even after adding a lot of extra olive oil, it was very thick and couldn’t be drizzled. the pictures showed it to be white but it was brown. with the extra oil it separated oddly. everything else was quite good. the fish could have could longer and/or at a higher heat than instructed. it was not seared and seemed maybe slightly undercooked."
The lunch option is an incredible choice. It would be great if other menus offered this.
Delicious!
This was nothing special. We were not very impressed with this meal. It seemed to be lacking sauce or taste. Perhaps breading the fish with panko and the spices would have improved the taste.
"i made the paddies to think so the cook time was off, if i had known to thinned them out it would have been perfect."
Box was missing the dijon mustard for this meal.
Tastes good...only because I happened to have the ingredient they missed in my order: mushroom broth. It isn't even listed in the ingredient list but is required in the recipe!
Great flavour and super fresh taste
comfort food
Flavour of the chicken was really good but the texture of the orzo and flavour was not appealing for us.
really really good. The meat was so tender. We added horseradish to the ricotta vinegrette for a little kick

Awesome
So good
kale was hard and stems were all chopped and included in the bag.
"A little boring, ingredients not worth the money, lacking in nutrition."
"Quick and easy, the wonton crisps were a huge hit"
The meal was loved by the whole family. The buttermilk biscuits were great with the flavour addins and the chicken was a hit.
The almond tabbouleh as described by the original recipe had nothing to do with almonds - none were included.
"Chicken was amazing, coleslaw was bitter"
So delicious!!!
This did not turn out at all like the picture-too much dressing...and chicken was not crispy at all -thumbs down
"too much ginger, otherwise it was great"
This was the best recipe of the week but needed something. We used tortilla shells we had to wrap this up
Ok not as giod as the other two
THE best steak ever !
delicious!
There was almost too much onion and kale to pasta ratio. It was mostly kale and onions with a little of pasta unlike the photo above unfortunately. It had potential though!
Delish! My husband said this was one of his favourite recipes from chefs plate.
The flavours were quite delicious.
I really didn't like the ricotta sauce. Not sure why it was even necessary. The rest was great.
"easy and very authentic flavors, will make this again!"
"absolutely amazing, already made it once since"
"Tasted okay but the deconstructed format was tough to eat and would have been better as an actual burger! Also my lettuce and cucumbers had begun to rot, so there was no salad."
"I cooked the pork and the potatoes a little longer than suggested, which worked well."
Yummy and easy.
Broccoli needed to be cut a bit smaller to cook in recommended time. I added some green and red peppers to the stir fry.
This was amazing
Delicious!
"I found the Dijon in the coleslaw way too overpowering, I couldn't eat more than a few bites. The chicken and biscuits were delicious though."
Loved this
5 stars!! Really 5!stars!!
One bag of rice was open/emptied over the bottom of the larger brown bag. One carrot have a rotten end.
Loved the nachos but found the beans too strong tasting so didn't use them.
"Did not enjoy the fish, guess i better stick to lightly gattered fish. But my husband loved it"
I find the beef a little tough.
Batter didn’t really go crispy but really tasty anyways !
Disappointing taste
Should advertise that this is vegan. Not actually cheese!
"This didn't look like this photo and it was kind of unsure of butter milk recipe... overall, taste was really under expectations and taste was so doubtable followed by instructions."
Fish fell crumbled and apart very easily during cooking
A little more of the plum sauce would have been nice. Very flavourful and nice textures though.
this was one of our favorites yet !
coleslaw tasted dirty possibly old and batter didnt stick well.
Would have preferred chicken breasts over chicken thighs.
This was our worst Chefs plate meal. something was off/bitter tasting. we were not sure what it was. We ended up not eating it which hasn’t happened before.
Very good
The potatoes and quinoa mixture was not easy to drain sufficiently and thus the “burgers” were a little mushy but the flavours of all components was delicious!
too much lime
"This recipe was tasty, but the chicken did not come out looking or tasting like fried chicken."
Very good!
Deeelicious!
Recipe was incorrect - it did not say to have a separate bowl for the “breading.” Coleslaw was too strong. Biscuits did not puff up. Disappointed because we were really excited for this recipe
"potatoes were great, burger meat was very dense and bland"
"good flavours but not enough sauce for the pasta, ratio was off."
Recipe was great but basil was bad by the time we got our delivery so was unusable and we had to buy our own to add.
The salad dressing was fantastic but the potatoes tasted freezer burn!! They were truly awful.
A little boring but the peppered steak was nice.
Good flavour. Maybe some thinly sliced red bell pepper for a splash more colour.
the potatoes were soggy and had gone bad when I went to cook this recipe.
I was under the impression the potatoes were cooked according to the recipe but they were hard and gross after following the instructions I had to continue to cook them for over 30 more minutes and by then the sauce was gross and we were all finished supper
Yum.
We only received 5 tortillas instead of six bit of a bummer
Yummy and easy
The cut of meat was AWFUL! We had to salvage what we could.
"I have never thought of baking feta before, it brought out a whole new flavour profile. Loved this recipe."
Only issue was our delivery was late by a day so had to order food instead
Please partner with weight watchers. I may have to discontinue because it is too hard to stick to a diet plan with Chefs plate but I do love getting the meals
My taste buds didn't like the flavor of the sauce and didn't like the noodle texture.
Loved the sauce and the meal! The meatballs were fairly dense. Perhaps an egg or breadcrumbs would have made them lighter?
Buns quite stale
"In general delicious, but the noodles over cooked easily....and I think should have been rinsed I cold water, to stop the cooking process...."
Excellent serving of feta cheese provided. Great combination of flavours.
This red wine sauce was divine
"Quick, easy, and tasty!"
great
Wasn't sure if I was supposed to drizzle potatoes with oil because they ended up being a bit dry. The flavor of beans and chicken with dressing was amazing though!
directions for chicken were confusing. adding the coating mixture to chicken soaking in buttermilk just made it goopy and didn’t actually coat the chicken.
Phenomenal
Wasn’t a fan of the olives and I would dice the tomatoes more smaller to resemble a more transitional bruschetta
"Very dense to have the burger and wedges. Also, perhaps flavours I don't typically enjoy."

Loved it.
The green beans had gone bad and we're covered in white slime in the packaging. Two meals in a row the vegetables were going or had gone bad.
"Loved the burger, wished there was another less starchy vegetable also included."
"quite flavourless, half the family liked the kale and the other half did not."
"beans could have been cooked a little longer, steak was unreal though"
one more sweet potato would have made it perfectly filling
"Love this dish, very flavourful! Adding a Greek salad would have balanced the nutrition better and made it perfect."
Filling despite minimal protein
"Pork chops were fine. Potatoes were bruised brown/grey quite a bit and what we did cook as instructed wasnt edible as is do microwaved, in the end potatoes are being thrown out. Also a poppyseed sweet dressing would be better on the kale salad. This meal is our first big fail meal ftom Chefs Plate. ??"
Yum!
yum
Kinda bland and I had to add more tomatoe sauce as it was kinda dry. Might have been better with some sort of spicy sausage.
Inedible. The coleslaw tasted like pure mayo. The biscuit seasoning was awful and the chicken was disgusting.
I didn't get the chicken with this order so used my own. Found that the flour mix didn't really stick to the thigh and made a gooey mess in the bag when shaking.
Loved this!
Gross flavour. Buns had a gross spongy texture. Coleslaw was a pain to slice up. Chicken was fatty and there was not enough coating / was too liquidy.
Was very good but too much carrot for the other portions.
order was messed up and never recieved the protein i was so looking forward to..
wasnt a big fan of the taste or texture.
the chicken thighs were stupendously fatty and I spent more time trimming them than making the recipe. the breading for the chicken was laughable at best and barely stayed on.
Good portion sizes. Nice sauce for the chicken. I do wish the creamy dressings weren't mayonnaise-based as it adds a lot of calories to the salad lunch.
there was a previous similar recipe that was much better. this recipe had too much onion and was over powering. I Did not like the dish at all
"Potato portion sizes really unacceptable. You gave me 5 baby potatoes for 2 people. They were cherry tomato size. Disappointed, but I had actual red photos at home so I added one."
This was bland and we didn’t enjoy it much.
the meat was incredibly tender and delicious! very skeptical about the ricotta vinaigrette but ended up bringing the entire meal together!
very easy to prepare
would have been much better with strip beef/steak pieces
"This was very tasty, but not enough salsa was provided."
"I always order tacos, but these ones were somewhat of a disappointment. I was very disappointed that after 5 days the avocado I got was still nowhere ready to eat."
Chicken was amazing
"tasty, nice fish, took a little longer then expected"
The tomatoes were rotten within 2 days of receiving our box
the sticky maple glaze is heavenly. my new favorite thing to put on chicken. loved this recipe and will make it again for sure.
potatoes need more time to cook than indicated
"This was our first meal from chefs plate and we were not sure what to expect. Everything was put together well, preparation was easy and the meal was really good."
"a bit bland, I would have preferred more noodles for lunch rather than ruce"
really delish and very fast and easy to make!
A little dry
"very fast and easy to make, your Asian inspired recipes are always better than takeout!"
"It was very good, especially the green beans"
"This recipe needs more vegetables ( corn, avocado, tomatoes) and real lime juice instead of rice vinegar. This meal is overpriced for what we get."
Potatoes were dry and chicken as well
yum-my!
Nothing wrong with it but just too much like an easy pasta & jar of tomato sauce meal.
awesome
1 piece of Naan between 2 people was not enough as well as the portion. This was the only meal we were disappointed in for the week.

So good! And I loved how easy it was!
surprisingly very good
épice difficile a digérer :) mais autrement bon gout!
"Very good and flavourful, especially the potatoes!"
Was too much sodium taste
Potatoes needed to be cooked more than the recipe suggested. Everything else was delicious!
"tasty, but not particularly exciting."
"Tasty enough, might have been nice with some different kinds of mushroom"
Recipe didn't really tell you what to do with the reserved 1/4 cup of pasta water
"Enjoyed flavours and various components, but altogether not very much food."
Amazing
Could have used some more sauce or something so it’s not so dry. I added my own balsamic glaze
youre instructions need to change for the cook time on chicken ...20 min...12-15 chicken is still raw. The recipe calls for too much liquid in the biscuits...they turned out like pancakes. coleslaw had no flavour
It was a little dry.
The ricotta beans were a new and interesting combo I'd never thought to try!


"Very, VERY easy to make. And very tasty"
our first recipe from chefs plate was a success! It looked like the picture and tasted even better than it looked!
Pork spices were delicious -- full of flavour -- and the potatoes gratin added a nice element of comfort. Loved it
good but not filling enough
"the chicken did not get crispy and the biscuits didn’t rise in the oven, they turned out more like flatbreads"
Chicken tenders would have been better
This was so yummy! Definite favourite
So flavourful
Really good. Some packaging issues. The package of quinoa was ripped a bunch of quinoa fell out in the bag and all over my kitchen floor. Also recipe card not clear —paper towel baked to pita in oven
Same as fish comment

Love the flavours in this dish and the Naan is always so fresh!
Chicken was amazing!!!! Coleslaw was a little spicy
The cooking time of the potatoes and beans were not enought
Recipe with somewhat difficult to follow along with as well it calls for making your own buttermilk which I found to be difficult and confusing
This meal was delisious the only reason I did not give 4 stars was because there were some food items that were passed their prime upon delivery and had to be thrown out.
Good but boring
dijon mustard was overpowering
so good! will definitely make again
Beans a bit too spicy for the kids
Chicken was soggy
"the coating for the chicken did not apply well. the second it touched the buttermilk , it stuck to the plastic bowl I was using to toss it."
Interesting idea but sort of strange when executed
Brocolli stinks:(
The fish tasted like mush.
tasty

Poratoes were blend
The chicken and biscuits were delicious but the salad was heavy (dressing) and lacked flavour.
Delicious and full of flavour
It was ok. A little plain but filling at least.
instructions resulted in a paste on chicken. Coleslaw needed more flavour.
The pork was lovely but the potatoes were a little bland.
Steak was really nice and tender!
Meat?
Nice beef..recipe was so-so
Hard to cut the potato was a bit big. And nor sure why one potato would provide two serving. Only served one. Bit disappointed
The Very best chefs plate recipe we’ve ever had!
"the Greek yogurt was broken open, and the feta container was broken too and the feta had fallen out. I didn’t like the flavours."
batter for chicken did not cover it all. was not clear if it was meant to be dunked in powder separately
"I normally avoid chicken thigh, but this meal was delicious!"
Rice was not very good
I think this one was the best of the week! I didn’t use the cucumber - it was translucent on the inside-composted it. Overall it was really good!
Delicious. Only reason I don’t say 5 stars is because one sweet potato for two people was maybe not quite enough
coleslaw wasn’t good. Too much dressing not enough veggies
Sooooo tasty! LOVED this!
The seasoning could have been a little stronger in the fish. I found it kind of bland.
Not a fan the lime overpowered all the other flavours. But the cut of meat was good and there seemed to be more even though the same amount as previous recipe.
did not like the flavours at all. couldn’t eat it!
The steak was not good.
It could have been a touch more chicken
We needed to add some spice...abit bland
Delicious flavours and easy to make.
more tomato sauce please so it doesnt get dry in the oven
Way too complicated with too many bowls
This is our least favourite of all the recipes. the chicken ended up being mushy and the coleslaw flavour wasn’t for us.
relying only on the nutritional yeast for the cheesy flavor was too new for some members of the family
"The recipe was confusing, the biscuits were dry and the coleslaw was not tasty."
Delicious
A 5 star rating category would allow for a middle 'it was okay' but not particularly good or bad category.
Delicious!
Delicious!
"The dish itself I would rate 4 stars but the salad had putrefied, the onions and hummus were rancid"
Un must! J'ai adoré!
the meat was very fatty
It said to cook the burgers for 12-14 minutes but they were not cooked. I had to cook them for 22 minutes to make sure fully cooked
beef a bit chewy
Very good! 9/10
Not very flavourful. The recipes have really gone downhill unfortunately.
A nice blend of flavours
Very good and easy
The steak was delicious!
Our kit did not have the 2nd spice packet for the lunch chili
Super disappointed I had to go buy an entire carton of milk to make this recipe.
Meat was tough. Balsamic was missing
Delicious and so easy to make!
Très bon au goût mais petite portion
Bonne recette et très simple. Couscous un peu fade au goût mais sommes toute très bien
Fish for some reason was very soggy .even though dried it before cooking .. the rest was good
Would never repeat again. Mushy fish and ya I threw out my plate and had cereal
Kale was too bitter in this
Biscuits were good but there’s no way the chicken was cooked after 12 minutes
"This was delicious but Ive never needed to supply my own milk for a recipe before and I didn't have any, which was frustrating"
Very tasty!
Simple ingredients make a light and delicious dinner we both loved
Our kit was missing the milk :(
One of the best yet for flavour! Would repeat this meal
Biscuits were like flat thin pancakes. Slaw was gross. Mayo + mustard is not a dressing.
"Lacked flavour, could use some more sauce of some sort. A bit dry"
I’d love to know what the spices were in it. They were unusual but very good.
These were tasty however we felt the quality of the buns was not so great.
Delicious!
was missing one of the sauces but it still tasted good
Potatoes were very original and good. Pork were a little bland.
"An extensive email identifying issues with this recipe was sent yesterday. In general, if I had paid more attention I would not have ordered chicken thighs - not my favourite."
Beef tough
loved the garlic sauce.
Excellent
Perfect!
Needs cheese ??
biscuits looked like cookies
Delicious
A little bland. The pasta wasn’t dense enough. The crispy shallots were a life saver for this dish.
Loved it
The Taste was fine. The flaw was in the recipe. Way too much buttermilk in the bowl with the breading. Turned into a clump .. couldn't adequately coat both pieces of chicken.
"Clearly the best of the meals this week. The beef cooked up so amazing. Was full of flavor and very tender. The potatoes needed more cook time, overall best so far"
"The chicken was the best part, the Dijon and the red cabbage created a strong bitter flavor profile that was not pleasing. The biscuits were ok, would have made a better sandwich"
one of the best!
Just ok
"My second time ordering it, much better this time when I cut the cauliflower much smaller to the point that it was basically part of the sauce. Just my personal opinion though."
All of the produce was at the end of life when we made this dish. Makes me question the value of money for chefs plate since the acquisition.
The biscuits didn’t rise at all but they were tasty.
Steak was stringy
will not get again..but these where picked for us and was very disappointed.
Beef was very tough. We couldn’t eat quite a bit of it.
This is a family favourite. Would prefer it with a fresh fettuccini though.
kale was still kinda crunchy and I'm not sure I loved that.
Was good except the cilantro I received had gone bad
Potatoes were brown. Ingredients were a disappointment with this box
Portion de viande trop petite.
There is nothing resembling cheese in this recipe.
The meat was good but the rice was gross.
Enjoyed this comfort food!
Too much ginger
2 days after receiving it the onion is rotten i can't even cook this. This company is the worst experience i ever had out of all of them i have cancelled all my other orders
"beef was so chewy, and the rice was not good"
super easy and flavourful! this was a great week of meals!
This meal was particularly great! Loved it!
This was delicious with a variety of flavours and textures.
I didn't think I liked beets; I was wrong. This was delicious!
spicy but delicious
Was surprised when the recipe called for milk. We used to receive it in the order. Luckily I had some. I miss the amount of oil to add. The drizzle is an unknown.
"Mediocre, but alright."
we didn’t love it. maybe would’ve been better in a pita?
The potatoes took way longer than the time the recipe said to cook. They should have been started first.
"Our first vegan meal, I think, and we loved it!"
Steak & potatoes always a winning combo. Green beans a bit too often but ricotta a nice twist
"Deliciously garlicky very tasty meal. Although it rarely happens, the Shawarma seasoning for the chicken was missing. Got 2 hummus servings. Used 2 different types of seasoning salt & garlic on the ch"
probably my least favourite dish yet. Pork chops were good but the salad was pretty meh and the potatoes were gross in texture and still cold. It had potential though! would like to see this recipe in a non-15 min variety.
Really enjoyed!!!
"The recipe for the burgers was good. The tomato that was included was really poor quality on the freshness scale. It was very soft and spongy like. I prefer the brioche buns, they are way tastier."
This was awesome! Great flavours!
"I felt like this was missing something. It was good, and I will keep the recipe for future use, but I will try adding some other seasoning or sauce or something."
We didn't receive the milk for the recipe and biscuits were spicy but bland
"Nothing too stand out. Either not curry enough or ""cheesy"" enough"
"Loved the biscuits and coleslaw, and the chicken flavour was great, but it wasn't crispy without the extra step of frying it, and didn't look like the picture. Would make again."
"Steak was tough, sauce too acidic - overall our least favourite meal"
Favourite recipe so far!
Meat was marinated in chemicals. Very disappointing
Needs more garlic sauce.
The fish was delicious. The vegetable portion was too small so I added roasted carrots to it.
The fish was terrible. It was very watery and fell apart.
Bland. Fish wasn't great. Need to up the quality. More tilapia.
Burgers are always a hit with my family!
Slaw had way too much dijon.
"The chicken did not come out crispy at all, unfortunately."
Would be good to have more toppings for the burgers
would like a little more sauce
"poor cut of chicken, it was inedible. threw it out after first bite."

"The fish (Basa) isn’t a ‘healthy’ fish , tabbouleh a little bland."
did not enjoy this on aside from the biscuits... chicken was fatty coleslaw was wilted and no milk included when it normal is very dissapointed
"Overall we enjoyed this burgers, we loved the feta cheese sauce. The salad was excellent and fresh as well as the pita bread. Our only complaint was the burgers themselves were crumbly."
this steak was a nice cut
too much kale - overtook the other flavours
"Tasted really good, but I didn't know I needed my own milk, first time a recipe expected me to have something that wasn't oil or salt/pepper. I would have appreciated more warning"
Milk is not a common household item. this is the first dinner we've had where we didn't have all of the basic ingredients... something we didn't discover until we had already started. Disappointing.
Yummy!
My kids loved this meal. Great twist on a classic mac n cheese!
the coleslaw was too bitter
the “ground” turkey is always more of a goo that needs to be pulled apart by hand rather than broken up in the pan.
The portions are so incredibly small. I think I ate like 15 bites of potatoes.
"This did not turn out the way I expected it to, my end result looked nothing like the image"
"Did not come with milk, had to go to store mid way through the recipe."
salad left us wanting.
The meat was very tough. Not easy to chew
I really like having veg options with high protein content. I wanted to love this recipe but flavour of burgers was just okay for me.
Cooking times were (are) longer than in the recipe for both the sweet potatoes as well as the burgers
The chicken was spicy and the recipe instructions were not very clear
Best steak I've had ever! One of the best meals ive har from ches plate as well
Shawarma flavour was quite good and felt authentic. I wish there was a little more attention or focus on the veg component in all meals. Veg & high protein content are what I’m looking for in recipes.
"The beef was a bit strange tasting, but the rest was ok!"
wish portions were a bit larger....great meal though
very tasty...really enjoyed...husband wishes portions were a bit larger
Did not enjoy the flavor combination of the dijon salad and the cajun biscuits. HOWEVER....the chicken was the best chicken we have ever had. Ever !!
"Tomato was not so fresh, a few of them were soggy and mushy"
did not turn out crispy as expected but still tasted good
Bag arrived with quinoa and the yogurt busted so did not get to try this dish
Recipe has error coating was too wet

"the batter didn't stick to the chicken, even though we followed the directions. We found it soggy and it made a mess of our sheet pan (yes it was greased!). The biscuits were surprisingly easy to make"
loved it!
Very yummy the tomato was packaged wrong and was very bruised could not use it!
We added flour tortillas
Loved the flavours!
I would add corn and avocado
I added corn and red pepper
très bon!
have not eaten it yet

"A little bit too much onion for my liking, but overall very good!"
Taste was ok but I was disappointed that milk was not provided in the ingredients. Milk is not something I have at my house constantly so it was very inconvenient.
the steak quality isn’t the best
Didn’t like the wraps
"There was a tiny issue with the order, but Chefs Plate made it right. The meal was absolutely yum!"
Excellent!
"Pasta didn't mix well with the kale, very clumpy"
Too much kale
This portion was delicious and large enough for leftover lunches the next day.
"Steak was soo good, loved the pepper corn ""crust"""
Best of the week. Introduced me to nutritional yeast. Will be making this again.
Delicious
So yummy!
Delicious and Easy!
"Great recipe, sweet potatoes were way too small"
Didn't get to eat them . Shipment didn't come until Friday all the food smelt rotten . Pissed
This is a 15 min meal but it wasnt worth it because the potatoes were undercooked and not soft. We placed it in the oven for a longer time but it still didn’t soften up.
Meat was tender and nice
Really good dressing
Chicken was soggy. Was missing vinegar in box
Wish kale salad was not a mayo base
"Great, loved the flavours"
Something was definitely wrong with the recipe here. I’ve already let them know.
I loved the dressing
Good
"didn't like the coleslaw, but liked everything else!"
The tomato was too bruised to use.
Yummy flavours and spice plus filling
The spices and the homemade garlic sauce was extremely flavourful!
My boys LOVED the chicken. They are not huge fans of coleslaw.
"It would be nice to find a crispier alternative to the carrots, as ""fries"" they're just soft."
"Weirdest instructions to bread chicken I've ever seen. What happened was the bowl with chicken and breadcrumbs became a slimy mess, and there was no excess crumbs to shake off. Will not try again."
This was very good ;)
"Delivery driver left outside, all produce was frozen."
"Delivery driver left outside, all produce was frozen."
Liked everything but the Dijon
The kale was a little to much for me.
Really good ! Except the tomatoe was rot
I don't buy milk so this one is still sitting in the fridge waiting to be prepared.
The meal was good but my cherry tomatoes were mostly rotten.
By far my least favourite so far
SOOOOO FLAVORFUL!
"I have no trouble with most, but these instructions were a bit confusing and never stated that the vinegar/milk combo now became the buttermilk, and I thought it was referring to the buttermilk biscui"
"felt it needed more spice, otherwise delicious"
this recipe was fantastic! amazing combination of flavours.
a bit too much Dijon
delicious!
Tasted good but could have used another veggie
Too much carrot included. A fairly basic recipe.
"I do not like the pre-boiled potatoes that are provided in the 15 minute meals, as they were either not cooked sufficiently (resulting in additional cooking time of 20 minutes) or not appealing visual"
The burger itself was really good. The tomato was very sad looking and unripe and there was way too much dressing for the salad.
average
average
Super fun and tasty. Loved that ginger plum sauce
amazing seasoning
Tasteless
Delicious
Really different and tasty
Absolutely delicious !!!
"I loved it , hubby suggested chicken be an added option for it"
"The perfect amount of cheese, whole family approved"
Did not like that the pasta wasn't fresh
Simple and tasty
Sweet potatoes were a bit underdone. Maybe my husband cut too large pieces
I always cook green beans longer than recipe.
The vegetable to meat/rice ratio was off. Needed way more vegetables. We had to buy more to supplement.
"Potatoes were cold, needed more time in the oven before broiling"
Beef was really tough (even though I cooked it to med rare).
Maybe pan fried chicken we be better. It spit and smoked up the oven a lot
The potatoes were not good - too hard even when cooked more. The dressing/sauce wasn't great. The pork chops were great - with the sauce.
Beef was very chewy and not very good. Flavors were great though.
Tasted like a spring roll. I didnt love the type of cabbage but over all very good.
This was meant to be a 15 min menu but the potatoes needed a lot more time than in the recipe and were quite bland. We weren't keen on the dressing for the salad. The pork chops were delicious.
"Terrible, stripes of beef way too big and much to lean which made them tough, I was hopeful for the sauce until the lime was added and as I suspected way too much acid, I ate two bites and threw away"
The coleslaw was very delicious along with the biscuits but the chicken came out a little soggy. Still a very good meal
Great! Loved this one
too little meat
"Steak was tender. I would like to see a bit less in vinegar based sauces, dips or dressings. There have been too many vinegar ingredients."
"A bit bland...with limited texture. An added protein (sausage, chicken, beef) would have added to this dish."
There wasn't enough for 2 people
Huge portions! Was enough for 4 meals for me.
Good but a little bland
Loved it.
"Some of these ""meat and potatoes"" recipies are a little on the un-exciting side. THat said, the steak was super tender."
Delicious! Everyone loved this and I would definitely make it again.
These burgers were full of flavor and super easy to make. The dressings were absolutely divine.
What about this is a burger?
Could of had more toppings like avocado or tofu.
Je n'ai jamais reçu mon panier ??
"The fish was not fresh, not good at all."
"The green beans were really tasty. The potatoes needed more time in the oven, and the vinegar/ricotta cheese vinaigrette wasn't our favorite."
My family just didn't like the recipe
"Cooked to perfection, beans and sauce... a great added touch!"
Not my favourite.
We found the beef quite tough
Loved it.
Wontons completely burnt before the cooking time indicated on the recipe card.
Delish! The hummus and pickles were a nice addition.
delicious!
"I think that the meat should last the week that it is advertised for, nearly missed out on this great meal!"
"The brown rice was mushy, would rather have cooked it from raw for a better taste since I didn't eat it."
So much kale!
Potatoes did not cook easily - very hard and cheese sauce was unremarkable.
Simple. OK.
the chicken was “fried” like the picture showed.
I feel like it's missing a spice of some kind but good!
The coleslaw dressing didn’t work for us and there wasn’t enough chicken breading
Very small portions
"Really enjoyed this recipe, the biscuits were so delicious!!"
"This was one of the very best recipes we've had! The shawarma seasoning was so delicious! The garlic sauce amazing... we put it all over the whole dinner!! Hummus, the best I've had!!"
Biscuits and chicken good coleslaw could be a lime vinegarette
"Needed a little bit more flavor, but otherwise good."
Coleslaw was very bitter.
Surprisingly good. Found the instructions and timing a bit confusing.
so good
So flavourful for a 15min recipe!
Didn’t receive the milk required but otherwise good flavour
"Good, but I prefer real cheese. Was a nice option for dairy adverse diners."
Just wasn't that flavourful. One of our least favorites
Good flavour but beef was a bit chewy and could have used more vegetables
Thought this would be better. Too onion-y and I had to sub the kale for spinach because it went bad after a couple days.
Greens not fresh enough to eat
too bland
I love easy meals that requires me to pretty much dump it all in 1 pan - and it was yummy!
Loved the mixture of cauliflower with the pasta! Would love to see more options like this instead of only pasta base!
it was soooo delicious!
Yummmmm
Really good! Little tangy due to the lime but we enjoyed it!
Biscuits did not rise. Batter would not stay on chicken. Clumpy pieces of batter were disappointing.
The best thing I've ever gotten from CP
A new favorite!
This took longer than the instructions said it would. I won't order this one again
Was there a step missing? Chicken was not crispy. Biscuits were like pancakes. had to throw out entire meal.
We added shrimp to this meal and it delicious!!
Potatoes showed up rock hard
"It’s a tasty, but heavy meal."
Very poor. The potatoes were so undercooked the way they came even after extra cooking just to warm them up let alone cook them
Steak was great!
great flavours. could have used a little sauté on the garlic to lighten the heat.
excellent burger
My order never showed up
Had to go and buy new sweet potatoes as they arrived moldy - received plate credits for having to go and buy replacement produce. Delicious burgers though. Used the leftover dijon sauce all week!
Aweful. Threw it out.
Wontons were missing and I don't like cilantro so was not a good choice for me


Every component of this meal was amazing. The potatoes were fanatic.
a bit too much on the sour side
We really enjoy these spring roll bowls.
Tasty
Ok
This recipe was the worst Chef's Plate recipe I've ever had. The chicken was slimy and the breading had a very strange off putting flavour. I would give 0 stars if I could.
I enjoyed the Taquitos but the cabbage slaw was too much. Would like some other vegetable to add onto the cabbage.
A bit bland. Rice cooked up nicely. Would have preferred more ginger flavour.
I added some honey to bring in some more sweetness to balance the acid from the lime.
Tasty
Very garlicky but delicious. No kissing after
this was fabulous!
Really enjoyed the salad and the chops.
Simply Delicious!
"i overcooked the wonton crisps, they warned me!"
Buttermilk buscuits were not very good but chicken was nice
"Lack of flavour. The pork was not tender, suggestion using pork tenderloin for fast cooking."
Fantastic! Will eat again.
"Delicious, slaw wasnt great but the rest was so amazing!"
delicious!
"Cilantro had gone bad, none of it could be used so the dish lost a lot of flavour."
Excellent!
Wasn't as flavourful as other recipes I've tried
Phenomenal flavor.
Needed more veggies
Even the wife enjoyed this one
This recipe benefits from added rice wine vinegar and chili
"Hummus delicious, couscous was bland, garlic sauce was too strong and only used half the portion of garlic, my kids wouldn’t eat it. Chicken and spices was great"
The vegetables were rotten. They smelt off when opened. We still cooked it in case it was just the scent. But it tasted incredibly bad and had to be thrown out.
Very yummy
I added extra cheese. The sweet potatoes as the chips was excellent!
Kids loved this one
"Love the glaze. So simply, but so, so good!"
"We understand that it's supposed to be a deconstructed spring roll, but the tastes of the different elements did not seem to go well together. The wonton crisps were the only part I enjoyed."
Disappointing quantity & quality of ingred. Chicken breast half the size of other similar CP chicken orders. Potatoes black and had to be thrown out. Half beans rotten. NOT COOL GUYS!!!
Loved the glaze on this one! Not a fan of Parmesan so I substituted garlic with the green beans and was very happy.
very disappointed we were not able to eat the green beans because they were no longer good and moldy
recommend instead of soy sauce for the meat... a soy glaze. It was a little bland so didn’t stand up to rest if dish.
There are a lot of noodles but flavour rad good
- biscuits did not turn out - very wet and had to add extra flour. - chicken was not “crispy” had to much milk in them. - salad waaaay to heavy in mustard - inedible . ??
You were suppose to send chicken breast s. Instead I received chicken thighs which I hate
tasty but not enough food. 1 sweet potato was not enough and there was way too much bean topping. maybe I was missing a 2nd potato?
I followed the recipe as on the card but it was too much milk for the biscuits and ended up with pancakes not biscuits. Salad dressings seem to have dijon so it's quite repetitive. Chicken was tasty
This tasted good but the basil was limp and black. The mushroom as little buised. Just not as fresh as I'm used to from you guys.
Didn't love it. A curried chicken and pea pods would be my recommendation
Broccoli was delicious
more black bean dishes would be amazing! love them!

Very good
Les fèves netaient pas fraîches. Toutes gluantes et molles.
It was good even though I didn't watch my times carefully! Beans were a bit mottled when taken out of the bag.
"Really good recipe. Unfortunately, the onion that came with it was rotten. Luckily, we had an onion, so it was okay."
"Not a big fan of the texture of basa, but good flavor overall"
Wish there was more steak
avocado provided was not ripe enough to use (cooked 4 days after order received); salad or other side dish needed with this meal
Great dish!
the chicken was spicy my kids wouldn’t eat it
I added a little balsamic vinegar and red wine to boost the flavour.
Yummy!
this was awesome! love how garlicky the sauce was. please put this one on the menu again!
It was delicious! It was very quick to make.
"No vinegar sent with package. Had to guess at amount. Menu was first fail for us. Biscuits too thin, coating did not stick to chicken. Suspect buttermilk not thick enough !! Vinegar portion may have helped."
delish
"recipe wasn’t very clear, said to use the buttermilk but there was only buttermilk mix without any instruction on how to use it"
should be fresh pasta
Easy and so so yummy! Only complaint ks there wasnt enough! The birger buns were a little small and our family of 4 would have had a little more.
Very Good we loved it.
"More sauce, more feta needed"
The cooking time for the potatoes was way off. We cooked for more than double the recipe time and they still weren't cooked.
the pork chops were not fresh

wontons were very floury
Vraiment surprenant
"While the pork chop and kale salad were alright, the potatos didn't have much in the way of flavour and the texture was off. As if they had been frozen.....were they?"
"basil unusable, mushrooms not fresh. otherwise great recipe"
So yummy!
"Too much soya, not enough maple syrup"
no flavour!
It was a good recipe but marred by the tomatoes and old lemon. Please send canned tomatoes instead.
The coating on the chicken reminded me of how my Mom used to prepare chicken - it was so delicious! And the biscuits were so good!
"Very good, just found the potatoes dry. I think the instructions should have added a drizzle of olive oil on the potatoes instead of just the seasoning. Otherwise this meal was great!"
"Not as flavorful as I wanted, but easy to make"
need more protein - added tofu myself
a bit long to make but really tasty!
loved it but maybe garlic bread or salad with it too
"kids didn’t like it, lack taste."
Amazing flavour
great flavors!
I added spinach to get some greens.
"we did not like this at all. the biscuits were too spicy and didn’t cook well, the breading on the chicken didn’t stick and got under the chicken and tasted raw in places and the cabbage salad was very bitter and the Dijon overpowering."
This was soooo flavourful. I'll definitely remake it
steak was tender but ok
"Ok, we added a bun"
I feel like it needed a sturdier meatier fish because the texture of the millet is also soft. flavours were excellent.
the wonton wrappers needed something on them to give them flavour.
This was the worst meal I've had with chefsplate. It had no flavour at all.
some sauce on the bun would have been nice
"I wasn't sure how this would rate with my kids, but sooooooooo delicious! We loved using the wontons to scoop up our food!"
"Excellent! Super quick, super easy and super delicious."
"""preroasted"" potatoes were rock hard and grey, so obviously not cooked. Even after roasting them for what would be a full roasting time for fresh potatoes, they were barely edible and looked awful. We only order 15 minute meals when there are no other options for us. We will not choose any in the future."
I don’t know if I was given too much peanut butter. But that was a smack in the face of peanut
Excellent! Kids were begging for more chicken :-)
Excellent recipe!
could have done without the sauce as it was not very good. everything else was awesome
"terrible proportions. too much coleslaw, there wasnt enough breading for the chicken. the chicken was small but very good! I screwed up the biscuits so they didnt turn out. picture was ""false advertising"". overall weird meal unfortunately. would not recommend."
Yummy!
"there was not enough breading for the chicken, and I really didn’t like the coleslaw :( biscuits were delicious though !"
cilantro was slimy had the throw away all
Turkey burgers a bit small in portion. The meal on its own wasn't enough for two people. I had made a salad in addition to feel full. Otherwise the meal was ok.
Would be nice with some meat inside this dish or actual cheese. Decent flavour and would make again.
yum
This was delicious!
turkey not included
Excellent
"good meal, very quick & easy to prepare."
sauce was too thick but it all tasted great
watch the salt in the rub
Loved the peanut sauce...and no wheat!

Amazing! And I'm not a vegetarian
Loved how simple this was!
Cheese always falls out of container and Ends up in bottom of bag
"salad was bland. Potatoe, following the instruction, was not cooked. Needed to broil for an extra 5 mins. Pork chop with sauce was very tasty."
"not quite the shwarma taste I'm used to, but still goos. and i loved how quick it was to make"
The kale was a weird addition and took over the taste of the whole dish
the flavour was great but I found the instructions for breading the chicken confusing/incorrect
Great flavour and aupwr easy to make!!! I would make this one again!
tiny piece of steak for two people. (not enough) This is also hanger steak so not a great quaility of meat
needed more spice / flavour

"La sauce est trop salée (vous devriez l'essayer avec de la sauce soya réduite en sel ou encore du vinaigre balsamique à la place). De plus, les patates auraient besoin d'huile en plus des épices."
Pas assez de chapelure
awesome!
Needed more sauce or flavour
Delicious!
"This dish was really good, and the spicy kick of heat from the sriracha sauce finished it perfectly !"
"good recipe, added a bit more seasoning for more flavor."
"Tasty and good - everyone liked them. Good quality turkey, which was an issue before."
"Great - everyone loved it and it turned out well - the missing buttermilk threw me for a bit, but I was ok with supplying milk"
Once we added our own shaved Parm it was OK.
I really enjoyed this one.
Never received
Did not get the tomato paste
Sec
"Tasty, would be better if the wraps provided were bigger because hard to keep together."
the millet seemed to take longer to cook. otherwise a good meal.
"the coating should have been crispier, it created sort of a paste with the buttermilk which was tasty but should have been crispy."
awful. not even close to the pics.
"Very good, but a warning about about being careful about the amount of sriracha sauce to use would have been helpful. It was too spicy for my partner."
I was surprised how good this was!
Very great flavour. I don’t usually like chick peas or cracked wheat. The roasting of the chick peas and the combination of the ingredients made everything delicious.
recipe card did not indicate where to add the garlic
"Powder Parmesan, 3 dried mushrooms and not enough sauce."
Fantastic! Whole family loved it!!
broiling wasnt enough to heat up/finish cooking the potatoes. no milk included with the ingredients.
"avocado was really hard, 4 days after the delivery"
"The green beans were slimy and mouldy and I had to throw them out. Fortunately, I happened to have some green beans in the fridge which I was able to substitute. I made this recipe on Saturday."
On the the best ever; our first time for this dish and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Only one comment is that the pasta was not as expected but a very large short cannelloni-type noodle.
too spicy
"good pork chops, but nasty potatoes."
"Loved all the seasoning, steak was super flavourful and tender but the steak portion was SO small. Definitely needed to be double the size. But overall happy with the meal and flavour."
This one was easy. I added extra chili powder from my pantry. Could include sour cream.
"unique recipe, never tried pasta this way. Good to try. Easy to cook"
too much rice
This was a flop for us. The coleslaw was bitter. The chicken didn’t have great color or flavour. The biscuits fell apart.
"A lot of flavor, and mixed exceptionally well with one another."
Chicken great and slaw. Didn't like biscuits
it was good the garlic dressing had quite a bite
chicken was too fatty and greasy would not reordering
"the produce from the 15 minute meals don’t last very long. you basically have to cook those meals the day you get them, and even then it’s hit or miss."
"The pieces of chicken were very small, although delicious. We found this recipe spicy even though it isn't noted anywhere."
"Biscuits and slaw were great, would have preferred chicken breast instead of thighs"
"My chicken was soggy with the oven frying, but the biscuits were delicious."
Need some additional seasonings
Yummmmmmy!
I didn’t really like this recipe. I found the only flavour came from the chilli garlic and that it was way too spicy. I would have rather have the carrots in some kind of sauce or pickled.
very small portion size
Very bland
We received chicken thighs instead of chicken breast so it didn’t quite turn out how I’d hoped
not saucy enough
"Our avocado wasnt ripe, however we had another one at home that was ready to go so it worked out fine. This was so yummy!"
"It was good, but I recieved chicken thighs and not chicken breasts, which I am not a fan of so I enjoyed the chicken less. Too much mustard given for the coleslaw dressing it overpowered the coleslaw."
"recipe called for too much milk, biscuits were runny"
A little dry. Didn't have a great cheesy flavour. Loved the shallots!
Really good flavour and textures. Loved it!
excellent. These meatballs were so delicious
Not enough spice. Great with hot sauce
"Didn't send me the buttermilk, the neccessary ingredient for the entire meal. I also felt the salad was lacking."
There was no garlic or tahini included in the chefs plate bag for this recipe. Very disappointed.
"Too many carrots, needed a variety of vegetables, we added cauliflower and mushrooms"
potatoes were a little hard...not quite enough time to heat through in a 5 mind broil
this was amazing! i think maybe including another sweet potatoe and less sour cream would be good.
"The buns were fine, but small and ordinary - we've always been impressed by the size, variety and quality of any bread product that's come before. Beef was excellent."
Did not enjoy the chunks of avocado in the salsa - just personal preference
Je n'avais pas la preparation des petit pain au babeurre ni les epices cajun dans ma boite ?
Excellent. Big win of the week. The sauce on the potatoes (used it for dipping rather than making the 'salad') was surprisingly good...first thing with dijon mustard in it we've ever liked.
My family really liked the chicken on this one.
very tasty
beans were old
some onion would have made it better
"The ground beef was a little chewy but otherwise, really tasty"
"The family loved the fish,"
One of my favorites! Great flavors all around and nice little change to the couscous
This was a bit bland! Needs some sauce or more tomato paste and cream.
a little bland with the curry. Was expecting more flavours
Great flavour!
"Chicken very good, potatoes not very flavourful"
"the meat was a bit tough, but overall a simple and filling meal"
Was just okay. pork was very tough and the kit didn't include the milk for the potato gratin so had to use water.
It was a bit to spicy but it was delicious.
Could have used some kind of sauce it was a little blah. Also avocado wasn’t ripe so had to go buy some.
We find it very flavorless
Delicious! A favourite for my husband
these were delicious
the sriracha is VERY hot. I put in only a tiny amount. Maybe you should warn people about how hot it is...and I like

Good flavour. Could use more than one naan for meal for 2 people.
I discovered I cannot cook rice though :o Wasnt a huge family favourite but I liked it :D
the recipe was good but I’m just not a big fan of pre-cooked rice it’s hard and time consuming to break apart but the meal tasted fine
This is my favourite so far
loved this dish
Really good but glad I have learned not to add all the spicy ingredient
I loved the different take on mac and cheese with the curry twist however would have loved a little more oomphf to the flavour.
The potatoes and onions were slimy in their bags and I had to use my own that I had in my pantry.
A small salad would have been nice with this
Added less lemon though
"great recipe, but package was missing the maple and soy"
very much enjoyed this meal
"I ended up using the sauce as a sauté sauce, rather than a drizzle on top, which I think was a better use of a tasty sauce. I would have preferred this with some chicken!"
Great flavors. Loved the flavor and additions for the lunches.
"Wonderful, delicious"
"Nice idea, but the flavouring on the fish was a bit weak."
Whole family LOVED this one

The shipment did not include the pork chops. A complete waste of our meal planning for the week.
"Good, but nothing exciting."
"The green peppers and onions were bad/gone off so I cut up my own. The cabbage was also a little brown but managed to have enough. Beef was very tough break up, but we did like the dish once it was made"
Delicious!!
didn’t like the lime in the sauce. thought it was WAY too over powering. meat came in HUGE chunks and had to be cut down before I could do anything with them.
Excellent
Terrible
I wasn’t a big fan of the olives. The buns and burgers were fantastic!
the ratio of dijon mustard could be cut way back. way too much for our tastes. biscuits and chicken great!
"The sauce was too thick, but overall was a very flavourful dish"
"Not my favourite from this week, but very easy and yummy. Perfect portion size."
More seasoning on the turkey burger!! Was dry and bland.
"my family’s favourite, would love it as an option once a month"
Needs more sauce and more mushrooms.
"If I could give negative stars I would. The steak was literally 95% grizzle, this is not an exaggeration! Our meal was basically potatoes and green beans. Fail!"
Really good recipe and tasted so good!
I was very annoyed by this recipe. Milk is not something I typically have on hand and had to run out in the cold to buy it to complete the recipe. Grating carrots is also annoying. Not your best!!
Loved the seasoning! Maybe a bit too much mustard in the portion as the coleslaw was a bit bitter.
It was very disappointing that this recipe/meal did not include the milk. Unfortunately I didn't have any milk at the time I went to make this meal. (Even small amounts of butter are usually included)
"burgers took 30 minutes to cook, not the 12 in the recipe card"
This was the MOST delicious meal I have ever made! It was easy and soooooooooo yummy.
"I thought I wouldn’t like it, but I liked everything, including the green beans and I’m not a vegetable fan"
"Delicious! However, it would be awesome if there was some pita to dip into the hummus."
a little too gingery
Potatoes were terrible ????
Really quick recipe to make but potatoes were a little dry and I would have liked a replacement for the mayo (potentially greek yogurt).
This was pretty good. The only problem is there was no cilantro included in our bag.
I loved this one. I love Basa fish.
"Salad dressing was not good at all, we couldn’t even eat it."
Fabulous!
there were chicken thighs in the box instead of ground chicken. Plus the buns (wonder bread tasteless hamburger buns) were pathetic. A good bun makes the meal!
Would love to know where I can get that shawarma spice!
great combination of flavours. the ease of the recipe was helpful. the waste is quite high thou.
Cabbage was very bitter but the chicken was incredible
Our new favourite. so satisfying and taste pleasing.
"The recipe was poorly written. Said to add the breading to the chicken in the buttermilk, which resulted in a gloppy mess that looked awful when cooked. We threw it out. Cucumbers were wilted."
I had to purchase new cauliflower and spinach as they were both bad but when I made this meal with fresh ingredients it was very tasty
Tasted really blend..
Meh
tasty but all burger recipes would be better with more toppings. Mayo and peppers just aren't enough to make it exciting.
disappointed with the cheap hamburger bun. We typically choose the burger menu items when they are offered and always have commented on a nice gourmet bun. this was a disappointment tonight.
"Really disappointing, biscuits were awful"
The potatoes and gratin were nooooo good.
"Was OK, but not a big winner for us."
We weren’t notified that we had to provide our own milk for this dish. We don’t keep milk in the house and had to make a extra trip to the store just to make this meal. We were very annoyed!
This meal is terrific! Will definitely make it again!!
loved the olive wedges and entire recipe
This was not a 15 minute meal - the potatoes needed to be cooked longer then what was said on the recipe card (extra 10 mins). I won't be getting anymore 15 minute meals -- not worth the extra.
everything is great except the sauce. we opted to make our own
I need to have my own butter?.....
"the meal was great but we didn't get any recipes, really disapointing"
The chicken needed more breadcrumbs. The biscuits were very average.
I was provided with chicken tenders rather than ground chicken.
"Fish was much spicier than expected, but with no warning. I would have used a milder spice if I'd known. Spicy ingredients are usually marked in red on the recipe card. Dish was good otherwise!"
"Salad and potatoes were delicious, however the steak could barely be eaten. Full of fat and very chewy. Not enjoyable to eat."
potatoes needed a bit longer to cook
"fell a little short but still pretty good. biscuits were pretty flat, and chicken wasn't very crispy"
good!
"it was in desperate need of some sort of heat, like a little sriracha."
delicious and easy to prepare!
A bit too much 'salad'
first recipe that ive needed other ingrediants other tha. salt anf pepper or oil. i needed milk. i dont have milm in my house so it was inconvenient. but tasted delish!!!
The coleslaw was not very flavorful.
Excellent!!
"Breading could have been more substantial, too much Dijon."
Dijon is such a strong flavour and is used in lots of the recipes. It also is not very kid friendly.
Very good
Beef was tough
This was DELICIOUS!
Easy to make
"It was OK, but wouldn't order it again. Have had better stir fries from you"
"tough stringy beef, but potatoes were tasty"
marinade on steak is very strong
"It would be nice if butter is also included, like how it used to be last year. I do not have butter on hand, so had to substitute with olive oil."
"Beef was really chewy, its possible I didn't cook it properly. Sauce was delicious!"
Steak was very grizzled. Hard to eat. Had to cut out pieces.
"I would prefer to make the rice, I know that adds a few minutes, but I find the block of cooked rice makes a very soggy rice, or burnt."
"amazing!! instead of doing the cabbage & carrots on the side, we put everything in the pan, and it was so so yummy. the wontons don't take long at all, be careful not to burn them!"
"terrible, tastless"
"Delicious!! But would have liked more salsa, had to add our own."
"The taquitos are terrific, and pair wonderfully with the guac. The slaw, on the other hand, is bland and unappetizing."
not please with the sauce taste.
Maybe take out fish out of bag night before to dry. Fish still wet even though pat dry when starting to cook
"Previously the company would send stuff like milk and sugar in with the ingredients. Shocked to find I needed milk, I don’t drink milk nor would I ever buy it.Had to use cashew milk and it didn’t work"
The tabbouleh needed much longer than 14-16 minutes to cook...I cooked it for almost 30 minutes and it was still chewy.
"Disappointing. Instructions were terrible as well (not enough clear direction). Lastly, this was not nearly an amount for 4 portions."
Amazing taste
So good! But I think there should be a little more steak. A fist-sized portion is good for one person but a little short for two.
needs more sauce or cheese
"Really tasty!! This was our first ordered meal and we were impressed. The two things to keep in mind...chips took less time than we thought and burned a bit, and our daughters found it too spicy."
Potato and beans were simar to other dinners and the meat was rubbery with no flavour.
"This was pretty good, could have used a little bit more sauce."
way too spicy. would’ve preferred low fat coconut milk. Would’ve also preferred knowing how much of the curry paste to use according to spice tolerance level.
hallomi portion was too small for 2 people. cracked wheat didn’t have any flavor
"Just awful, disgusting, veiny, fatty pieces of chicken! So disappointing!"
Missing a bit of spice
Good - the whole family enjoyed the meal
Poor meat quality
"Tastes great but the breading was difficult, this wasn't an easy recipe."
"The package was missing the breading, but otherwise, it was good."
Could use a bit more flavour / sauce.
"overall, the meal was good but only after I revised/supplemented it . Guacamole NEEDS cilantro in my book; luckily I had some frozen dried on hand; I also added dried onion flakes - so much better! The fish was very good and a savior for the meal. I also added cayenne to both taquitos and guacamole, but I do understand that is personal preference. I do not enjoy your coleslaw recipes - I find the recipes very basic, boring and often dry - not my preference. I do have a note about the avocado - this is the second time this week that I received produce that was basically half rotten I know it’s a fine line with avocados, but I will not buy/use black produce, and as this is not the first time (as I said 2x in one week) my confidence has evaporated. I will likely not be continuing with your service I will think on it for a few weeks, but I’ve heard similar stories from other users of your service so I expect I’m done"
just needed more veggies.
Really quite nice. The ciabatta needed something.
delicious and leftovers made an excellent lunch for kids
"would like to have more flavor in the sweet potatoe mash. pretty skimpy with the Brussels sprouts this go around, typically not the case. loved the sauce for and pork!"
"Good, could use more spice."
needs a source of protein
Chicken schwarma was great. Sheet pan sweet potato nachos so so. They forgot to send the potatoes with the pork chops so the dish was incomplete. Paid $124 for 4 portions. Not great value for dishes.
"I was sadly disappointed with this meal. the coleslaw was pretty bland and basic, the biscuits were runny because the measurements must have been off with requiring too much milk and the instructions for the chicken weren’t clear and it wasn’t coated well."
Very tasty! First Chefs Plate meal & I am pleasantly surprised!
tasty
wait too spicy
Really good. Would have been nice to have more hummus
beef didn’t seem lean. very chewy.
My partner loved this but I found the sauce a bit weird. Too much corn starch and not enough soy (so we added). Lots of meat though!
We really loved this meal and I appreciate the decent size of potaatoes and beans that came with the meal...the steak was so tender!!
it was just ok
"Noodles were good, but not the meal I expected."

Delicious and super easy
"One of the best meals I've had from Chef's plate. Tons of flavour, great sauce!"
"Takes awhile to make, fish portion is small so low protein."
Loved it.
Creamy without being too rich!
No flavour
all of the halloumi recipes are amazing!! Keep them coming!
Good. Patties stuck to parchment though.
"Did not really like the flavor of the coleslaw, but the biscuits and chicken turned out great. Would've preferred white meat to thighs"
very good!
"One of the best recipes so far, loved it!"
great recipe! Loved it.
fish recipes have been consistently disappointing from both Chef's Plate and Hello Fresh
I wasn't sure what to expect with this one. Initial flavour was surprising but we ended up loving it! So great.
Too bland. Did not enjoy this meal at all. Would prefer higher quality beef.
Not enough food for 2 people. And the cost of these ingridients is pennies compared to the price you pay
Added some zucchini as well. Perfect! The crispy shallots tied it all together.
"Fresh, flavourful and delicious. One of my favourites so far."
Très bon
Unfortunately we were unable to use any of the potatoes as on slicing them we discovered concentric black rings. They did not look edible; hence our meal lacked the item of the paprika roasted potatoe
"Delicious, hardy, homey, good recipe"
"Individual ingredients were appealing, but somehow the tahini with almonds did not work. When added lemon juice turned into thick paste. Did not look like the photo! Use couscous and real tahini pleas"
"I had my doubts about this one, but wanted to try because I enjoy a meatless meal, and this one wasn’t fantastic at all. The flavours didn’t work together and it the consistency wasn’t appealing."
The most tender steak I have ever cooked!
tasty with added vegetables
Too spicy for kids
"second time ordering this meal and still a favourite, a little disappointed we're not getting fresh pasta anymore"
Was missing the feta cheese
Not very spiced
Loved it and would definitely make this recipe again!
Made this recipe last ... had to throw out half the beans due to spoilage. The beef was nice and tender.
"I'm not sure about the cracked wheat still as it was the first time I tried it, but everything else was super delicious!"
waaay too spicy I used half of the ginger and one third of the curry and it was too spicy for me and my children . I find the vegetarian dishes tend to be too spicy for our family.
"The spice was missing from my package. Was bland without, and with what I had in hand."
amazing. maybe give cheese next time? I added some and it really improved the recipe.
The meat mainly consisted of fat. Only really enough editable meat for one person. Alot of it was thrown out.
"Good, could have used more steak for four people."
salad was pretty plain but the burger and poblano peppers tastes good. quick and easy!
This was delicious!
fantastic
Too processed
"Delicious, simple stirfry. Had to add more water to the rice than was suggested."
This recipe was really good!!
Need something crunchy in the burgers
Taste was amazing overall. I did find the chicken didn't quite have a coating as shown in the picture and I prefer a sweeter creamy coleslaw but would definitely have this again.
"more complexity would have been nice, but tasty"
"So good. My one gripe is that something that features halloumi as the ""star"" of the meal shouldn't be so stingy with it. More halloumi needed!"
Needed texture. I got the two tomato ingredients mixed up in timing and basically wrecked the whole thing (label more clearly)
Chicken didn’t crisp up like photo. Was just okay. Didn’t love the biscuits.
red cabbage slaw was a little meh. taquitos were super tasty!
"Was ok, but expected it to be tastier"
"Was tasty, our cheese was a bit burnt on the bottom? Like the colour and the crunch!"
fatty steak & boring salad
"instructions on the app were incomplete. wish there was some indication of how spicy it was going to be and a means of making us less spicy, depending on preference. not bad overall."
Absolutely delicious! I am keeping this recipe for myself. :)
Thought it was odd that the cherry tomatoes weren't intended to be roasted but I was happy that I did anyway.
not enough steak for two people ice fat is removed
too Spivey for the kids (maybe a disclaimer on amount of green curry to add)
A little too bland
This was again only a two person I expected family but it was good minus the peppercorns
my own fault...i forgot the wantons in the oven
I thought this had fresh pasta...nothing special about this recipe
I was so happy the cabbage was pre-shredded!
The cream leaked out in bag so could not make according to recipe.
super!
There was a problem with my order for this menu. I was compensated. Unfortunately I did not have enough crushed tomatoes and no one got back to me on the measurements so I estimated how much I needed.
buns too small.Not enough tomatoes.
the greens had gone slimy before I could use them so the dish was a bit boring
Could’ve had more toppings on the burger or been a bit more filling.
Absolutely delicious and easy.thank you
The burgers are always delicious- this was a real hit!
Steak was very small and a bit chewy. Flavours were good though!
amazing! I loved this dish!
"Missing items, chicken was very fatty. Called and meal was complimented which was appreciated. But, would not order this again. :("
Very tasty and easy to make!
Really nice but needed just a bit more seasoning/flavour
Excellent vegetarian idea.
The steak was tasty but it had a LOT of gristle. The rosemary mayo dipping sauce was divine.
"The pork chops were delicious and tender, the Brussels sprouts were well cleaned and well cooked when done according to the recipe."
Very good
"Steak was very bristly, but other that that was a very yummy meal, the Rosemary Mayo steak dip was sooo good."
Yummy but salty. Would probably also be delicious with pork.
meh
Love the mashed sweet potatoes as a change from the usual. Chutney added a nice touch of sweetness for the pork.
Could use less spinach and more rice.
Steak was a little chewy and fatty...
"My son loved everything, especially the pork."
I was surprised by how much my family liked this dish. The Halloumi didn't brown up as shown in the photo but the taste was delicious.
"didn't taste Asian. the bbqs sauce tasted like it should have been on ribs, not in an Asian flavoured sauce. We did not enjoy this."
"could have used a bit more cheese, and the recipe said to reserve pasta water, but didn‘t indicate where it was to be used ??"
Tasty. Cabbage side needed extra contents and flavour.
different beef would have been nice
another winner
"Tasty, but my box was missing the spice mix..."
Très bon mais il manquait un sachet de vinaigre blanc dans le sac.
Biscuits would have been better plain. Too much mustard in coleslaw
Such great flavours and a tasty warmed up dish the next day
This was tasty but the green curry was too spicy for my child who has normally loves Thai food.
"It wasn’t bad, but it was very plain and mild for a Vindaloo"
"it was a bit spicy without any other flavors for our taste. laced the broccoli and edamame. cooking the curry was messy and burned to our pot, it's not the way I would have made the curry sauce if it had not been in the directions"
C'était bon mais la moitié des légumes était pourrie
This was very spicy and was not listed as a spicy meal :( however it did still taste good.
The piece of steak we got was really gristly so there was a good amount we never ate.
We really do like a wide variety of “international “ meals but this one was likely the worst of the 50 plus meals we have had with several food delivery services
This was very delicious!! My only downside was that it didn't come in the family size so we didn't have any leftovers!
"The steak was terrible. The package said 'rib eye"" but it must have been from the star end. It was cooked according to instructions and was chewy and tough. Disappointing. Minor glitch was no mayoi"
more cheese though
"burger was delicious, but not a huge fan of the salad"
It was a bit too sweet.
would like liked more sauce
"Beef was little chewy, when med rare"
Burger was great but salad was meh and burger did not fill me up
Yummy. Fresh food (last meal cooked from the box) and good flavours.
I don't normally like homemade soup but this was great. The kids had it without the seasoning and they liked it.
Fun recipe to put together and very simplistic.
Not the best. Sauce didn’t thicken enough. A bit bland even with proper seasoning.
Very delicious! Easy to make!
"The mayo made no sense, but the rest was awesome!"
feel there was very little halloumi
The apple chutney was not a hit but the sweet potatoes were.
A tad piquant but overall tasty.
A little spicy but that can be controlled by letting the customer know that you can use less green curry. It was very good
"I would pay a little extra to get a better steak. Even though I cooked it rare, it was chewy and had too much gristle"
The peas were not good - had to throw away
Could have used another vegetable.
"While flavourful, it really felt as though there could be a bit of harsher spice added to this recipe to provide greater enjoyment"
the salad and potatoes were great! a different cut of steak may have rounded out this combination better
Steak was extremely fatty. End up throwing out about 1/3 of it.
"Excellent, loved it!"
pretty spicy
Red cabbage slaw was not good. Too sour
"quick, easy recipe."
Amazing. Couldnt stop eating the potatoes dipped in the mayo and rosemary
Dinner was very very good. Lunch so-so
"I liked it better without the parsley, but my wife like the carrots in it better with the parsley,"
"It was soooo good, I would order this recipe again anytime. The Tahini was not really necessary and can be swapped out with a lighter dressing like just lemon and olive oil. Loved this one!"
We usually love pasta recipes but not this one. So much kale in comparison with mushrooms - could not fit the kale provided in one pot. You used to provide the butter but not anymore - surprised.
Great Chutney
Delicious!
the sauce was excellent!
Could have used a bit of spice. And cheese!
Not as flavorful as I expected. Needed to add extra spices
"This was really tasty. My only complaint is in the instructions, it said to reserve cooking water, but didn't say when to use it. The water used was more than what was to be reserved. Confusing."
Love the flavor of the poblano peppers. A wonderful combination of flavors.

this was not a chowder but a runny flavourless soup
"SO GOOD! I don't enjoy Rosemary, but the whole set up allows me to simply omit that one part. The Brussel Sprouts were perfect, the pork so juicy and the chutney.....AMAZING!"
we made our toast into garlic toast
"absolutely delicious, but more meat needed"
bland. needed more old bay seasoning
"Delicious! Everyone loved it! Took an extra 30 mins to cut up Kale, mushrooms and leeks. Was way more than 6 portions !"
Delicious and easy! took 30 mins. Would advise to season meat earlier and leave to sit in fridge for more flavor.
timing on the recipe is a bit off but the dish was great
Cooking times needed to be adjusted.
spices on the chicken were delicious!!
"This was good, it would’ve been even better with a protein. I added shrimp."
"Delicious but a twist to the sweet potato mash would have been nice, such as pecans or brown sugar to add in."
Delicious! The sweet potato mash was a revelation (def prefer sweet to regular potatoes) and you can't go wrong with baked Brussels
"Delicious, will make this again."
"Cooked the burgers a little longer to get them golden brown, yum yum!!"
Super easy to make and super delicious!
Tired of the vinegar based dressings. Meat had a lot of grissle.
"Not enough breading for the chicken, there should have been 2 packs for the chicken for 4 people. It made the chicken barely coated."
Absolutely delicious...high quality beef!
Too spicy without the complexity of flavour I would normally find in Thai food. Like maybe it needed lime or lemongrass or something
NOT good. Threw out.
I think different noodles would have worked best.
Excellent sauce well paired with beef! Loved it!
The salad was very good but the burger fell flat.
Loved this recipe!!
fun healthier version of nachos and vegetarian with good protein from beans
it was flavourful but a strange consistency with the burger
Favourite!
Amazing. Absolutely amazing.
Fabulous!


The steak was so small is was barely enough for one person when it was for two
interesting flavours
Very good
The recipe itself was pretty good however I found the chicken portion too small
Quite good. The tabbouleh with broccoli and tomatoes was a nice touch!
I added chicken and the flavour was delicious. A little hot for me so next time I might hold back on the spice just a bit.
This is one of my top 5 recipes over the past 3-4 months since I started Chefs Plate!
Perfect
"was good, but not enough flavour variety. Needed something to cut the flavour of the garlic"
The cilantro was not fresh. Also didn’t like the big carrots.
Not very flavourful
This was more labour intensive than the final product was worth. It wasn't the best meal we've had from Chef's Plate by a long shot
"This was an extremely tasty version - and healthy, too!"
this way a good recipe but wish it included the milk.
the kale was not prepped great (lots of stalk pieces left)
"Loved this. Do not like the new recipe ""booklet"", much prefer the cards"

fresh pasta pleaaseeee :)
Decent but portion of meat was extremely small.
"I was worried these would be too spicy because of the amount of Sriracha sauce, but it was perfect."
Very good
Could have more of a kick / curry flavour.
Tasted like it was made by a chef! Delicious!!
Enjoy it
shouldn’t the Caesar dressing have some of the cheese
even better with avocado ??
meh
I liked the sauce.
Oinion were bad
too lemony
"Very tasty, nice change"
"good overall, strong garlic sauce and lettuce side did nothing for the overall meal."
2 burgers is a large serving size for 1 person
Our fav meal of the week! So many layers and flavours
Loved this recipe ( next time we would add a little less garlic but overall they were really tasty)
Delicious and easy to do.
"delicious, but allergic to garlic so didn’t use it. would appreciate being able to omit items that are not used to minimize food and packaging waste. have at least 4 unused jars of garlic, 5 unused packages of mayonnaise and 2 unused packages of sour cream. please let me know when this will be possible to omit the items."
Flavourful and great spice level.
delicious
lettuce was old so we had to throw most away but chicken / spices were good
"a little different, but pretty good! needed to add salt."
Delicious!
Not very filling & small portion of chicken
It wasn’t as great as I hoped
"Très bon, mais beaucoup trop piquant!"
Sauce was a bit too bitter
We substituted chicken as chow mein should be served with steak not ground beef
Halloumi and Cauliflower were both mouldy.
"You didn't send ground chicken, you sent chicken tenders. So I wasn't able to make this."
"Avocado was unripe, even late in the week."
"Very yummy, but the piece of steak was a little small for two people."
Fish tacos were very tasty but the slaw was not great.
It might just be me but my Jumble was more like a soup. I was expecting more of a stew like consistency.
If the steak hadn't been full of grissle and inedible it would of been a 4.
This one was good. But I found it a little bland would have liked a bit more flavour with the spice.
Was not a fan of this cut of steak

"I can't remember if it was this one or the burgers, but for one of them I got multiple packets of mayo. A single jar is so much nicer."
Would be absolutely great if it had some seafood or even corn and potatoes.
3 or 4 great for 15 min meal
"Too many noodles, took away from the leek,kale and mushrooms which should have been the star"
Steak was a bit fatty of a cut
"Great heat, just needed to add salt to enhance flavour"
It would be better with a steak rather than ground beef.
"Mmm, just ok."
Burger was great. Salad was plain but was and healthy.
I'd prefer to give it a 2.5 star rating. It was good but it didn''t have the complexity of flavours that I love from some of your recipes.
Overall I really enjoyed the recipe unfortunately my avocado was so over right as to be unusable .
I'm Spanish so I'm a tough critic on this dish. It was good but to me was missing the tradition spices of cumin and oregano.
No carrots in the bag
salad was underwhelming. The dressing needs improvement
Didn't recieve all the ingredients and wasn't able to make.
Superb burgers!
This was disgusting
Good meal
didn’t like the chow mein noodles
Brussels sprouts were bland.
the sweet potatoes take much longer than 8-10 mins to cook so they can be mashed
"I like most fish plates , very good ,but messy eating."
"Rice noodles I couldn't get right, not one for hot spice, quartered the hot spice ."
"Meat was small, not very tasty"
Our chicken was rotten ?? we ended up using ground beef we had and mix with the santa fe spice they were excellent.
There was no vindaloo sauce in the package so it was good chicken w basmati rice but not vindaloo since the main ingredient was missing ??
Delicious but not enough protein to have with lunch the next day.
Needs steak pieces and not ground beef
Whole family RAVED about this. Even the kids!
too much lime in recipe
A few more vegetables would have been wonderful.
I added cabbage and carrot to pan for last 2 minute !! Delish
Perfect!
steak was poor quality
You forgot to send us the curry paste
"Taste was great, but wish we could have changed the amount of spice as it was too spicy for members of my family."
Bbq flavour combo was a bit odd.
Not exciting
delicious
This was delicious and easy to make
"First experience with chef plate, the food was good, however I didn’t get my recipes with my order, and I couldn’t sign up and order through the app on my phone."
Loved how easy this one was to prep but the steak we received was really fatty and didn't leave much meat to eat at all. Also didn't think the mayonnaise sauce was needed.
Love it
Suggest volume of mushrooms could have been larger
Kind of bland
Excellent even when I didn't have the recipe and forged ahead on my own.
Cheese didn’t get crispy.
Good
"Beets and carrot not good, had to throw out."
"The flavours were good, but it felt like there needed to be more beets and carrots"
"The meet had really tough fat all throug it, otherwise it would have been good"
Would have preferred quinoa
Needed more flavour.

"This recipe was awesome and very tasty. Unfortunately our carrot was rotten, which is why we gave it 3 stars."
The steak was really stringy
A little sweet on sweet between the apples and sweet potatoes
The precooked potatos were so grey that nobody would eat them. They were quite disgusting and the steak was super tough.
We found that the sauce provided was too sweet and chemically tasting. Not something we'd order again.
Way too much carrot and lunch salad was not very good.
So flavorful! The sauces were delicious.
cut of steak had a lot of grizzle on it. Hard to eat
"Sufficient quantity, boring filling..fish + tomato only"
Gave this one to our Grandson
"cabbage slaw was a little bland, maybe needed a herb or something and the cabbage was a bit tru. the taquitos were delish!"
"Not a fan of “thai chili pepper” heat, so left out!"
"Easy to make, zesty apples!"
"Great flavour, easier than I thought it would be"
"Large portion, very rich, could have used a bright small salad in the side"
"Beef went off before we could use it, but recipe was still good otherwise"
I wasn't a big fan of the sauce.
Very tasty!
"flavor wasnt good, noodles turned to mush, spicier than expected."
Season potatoes more? Perhaps parmasan?
Didn’t taste anything like ginger beef. Bland
the peppers sent were all bruised and had mold - quite disappointing
Portions can be bigger
needs more sauce. added garlic
"We were sent the wrong type of chicken, strips instead of ground chicken - so the meal needed to be modified."
It was delicious but it was a bit too spicy which wasn’t unexpected
Brussel sprouts needed to be cooked a bit longer. Really did not need to add the butter to the sweet potatoes. Meat was very tender.
Having this tomorrow
Spicy for kids. Was a tad slimy. It would be great if the recipe card noted to use half the spice for mild etc.
The roasting time was too much for the pork and not enough for the Brussels. The sweet potatoes took too long to come to a boil - probably should have started them when preheating the oven. Flavours were great though!
my lime was dry. there was no juice in it.
one of the best we’ve had
One of the best we have had!
Flavor was great but the steak was very fatty.
wow
"Wholesome, simple, delightful"
Beef was too stringy
The taquito itself was tasty. I always have to add my own spices because there are never enough included. The recipes are too bland. The red cabbage slaw wasn't great.
The bag of white wine vinegar was empty to we had to use balsamic vinegar we had on hand. Otherwise the recipe was good.
Delish!
Easy to add some frozen shrimp
this was very good but why just a plain hamburger bun? when you upgrade the bun its so much better and also hamburger buns are cheap. your salads are usually very good but the dressing for this salad
BBQing the chicken burger on a Teflon sheet was perfect! Highly recommend.
Everyone liked it including the kids.
very flavourful ans delicious.
"I gave it a couple of pulses in the Vitamix, turning it into a puréed soup. It was equally as delicious!"
Didn’t love the cut of meat - sinuous
More kale than mushroom
Quick and simple.
more used to beef strips not ground beef
unfortunately i received thighs instead of ground and the

"The fresh pasta was always one of my favorites, I was disappointed that this was not fresh pasta anymore"
surprisingly good
"Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to try this. Our chicken appeared to have gone bad."
"The recipe was fantastic; however, the steak was a bit of a bad cut and I wasn't a fan of the pre-packaged potatoes."
Taquitos idea great but fish too bland.
very spicy but tasty.
not enough vegetables

Cooking time/temp for the vegetables is way off.
"Taste was good, rice was mediocre, could've used one more piece of chicken."
Don't like how the cauliflower was all cut up. Would prefer it sliced in half or a small whole cauliflower could have been put in.
Pork was bad when we got our chefs plate
This dish was excellent. I was surprised the sauce included smoky bbq sauce and the flavor wasnt too strong. very good!
Perfection!
Not what I would call true chowder. Lacked the chowder flavour and texture. Disappointed
The steaks were awful. Seasoning was good though
sauce turned out to thin not our fave
Delicious! Would eat again :)
"steak was a quite fatty, but recipe was nice"
Liked the spicy kick!
"Not enough sauce, came out dry and kale did not fit the type of pasta or meal"
"The recipe indicated that there would be fresh pasta, but it was dry pasta. A big part of why I like Chefs Plate pasta recipes has been the fresh pasta, so this was disappointing. Nice flavor though!"
this was so much more delicious than I was expecting! very simple ingredients but all added up nicely. and I love how much kale and fresh veg snuck in there
Sauce was good but lil low on cheese and other veg..mostly cauliflower.
Loved this!
Delicious
Would definitely get this recipe again.
Yum! Perfect
I added a bed of greens to lighten this up but it was great!
These were amazing!
"Lacking any depth, and the sauce could have been thicker"
The wonton crisps don't bake as fast as it says. The mean was delicious!
The dish was great but the spinach and cauliflower were rotten and had to be replaced from the grocery store
Why the decision to no longer have fresh pasta? This is disappointing.
"Boring, taste wasn’t great."
Sweet potatoes were undercooked according to the instructions.
Really easy and really good.
Delicious!
A good mixture tang and smooth cheeses
the ingredients were still fresh to use considering I received the delivery on monday. Everything was proportional and very tasty! Would definitely try again!
Loved it. So easy
"The cucumbers were rotten when we opened the bag, but was good"
Didn’t hit the mark - tasted weird eating pasta with a runnyish curry sauce. Not tasty enough for the calories being consumed
loved
Delicious and perfect my husband was so happy with this meal we can’t wait to have it again!
"Wonderfully tasty, easy preparation and within the recommended daily dietary caloric intake I need stick to."
Very small portion size
Delish!!!!
"chicken portion size was a little small, otherwise everything tasted great!"
I really like one bowl meals - and this is a great one. The ginger plum sauce is perfect.
"Fish was good, but the dressing /flavour for the tabbouleh was less appealing"
kids found the oven fried chicken a bit too spicy (peppery!)
the chicken was very dry
Yummy! Great cheese flavour with out the cheese
good quality meat - no need for the cheese sauce
Fish was soggy.
Taste was great but portions quite small
"The chicken and salad were perfect and so delicious. The biscuits were a little disappointing, I think the remaining buttermilk was too much as the dough was runny so not a great presentation."
"needs more ingredients (chili, mushrooms"
Didn't get to try the buttermilk buiscuits as the mix was missing but the chicken and the coleslaw was very good
Couldn't you offer a better quality of fish....
the couscous is quite bland. The only thing that made it edible was the garlic sauce.
I would use parchment paper for the chicken as well - they stuck even to the oiled pan.
We really enjoyed this meal—steak was outstanding
"Not enough breading for chicken, only enough for 2 servings."
The dijon overpowered the salad and the biscuit seasoning wasn't appealing to us.
"It was delicious, but it didn't taste particularly of thai or curry or mac n cheez. I would change the name to creamy one-pot pasta spinach."
"This was just ok, was lacking in flavour and it didn't turn out anything like the photo."
I prefer the fresh pasta. Didn’t enjoy this one.
It tasked good but made very little (it needed another potato).
Used my own sweet potato as the portion size is just too small!
"I didn't realize at the time of ordering this that it required a dish to bake in the oven, so that should be more clear if you offer this recipe later."
small portion of steak but still a great meal
Fabulous! Best meal from Chef's Plate yet!
We didn’t have milk! This came with butter milk before
millet not particularly exciting- strange aftertaste from perhaps some of the spices fish itself excellent
Average but still good.
Flavour was nice. Needed to supplement noodles. Ground beef is difficult to pick up with chopsticks. Steak slices would be better.
Very tasty.
oduce was terrible!
very tasty!
My son and I enjoyed these even though I had to use only half of the Chipotle or it would have been too spicy for him.
yum!
very tasty
The potatoes weren’t precooked enough to have a broil get them cooked.
Of all three this was better than most however I kept having to add water to cook the rice which then diluted the flavor. I did not add the rice vinegar to the salsa pepper mixture as I learned from
buttermilk biscuits i made were not as fluffy as the one in the picture
I was disappointed with dish as the produce was unuseable as it had gone bad (the whole bag of lettuce was wet and slimy)
"really simple, fast and yummy"
excellent flavor
Really good but small portion. Only 1 sweet potato and should've been 2.
They were something I would have never thought of making. Easy and delicous
"Was disappointed in this one, first time ever. Instructions didn't work - buttermilk didn't thicken, chicken didn't coat well."
This one was my favorite. It was hearty and satisfying. Comfort food at its best!
This would have tasted alot better if we had been given the spices that were to be used.
Coleslaw had too much mayo
Really like the seasonings on the chicken!
Missing the chicken to make this meal
"Slaw was delicious, biscuits were easy. Chicken wasn't as crispy as we thought it would be. But a nice meal"
"Delicious but burgers were a little bland. Great portion size, very filling"
The sauce was amazing
Chicken thighs aren’t my favourite but the flavours were great!
The package arrived open and did not include the spices. Overall this was not a good dinner.
"The salad and the pork chops were really tasty. This was a relatively quick meal, however, there were A LOT of dishes to clean up afterwards."
Sounded good and the chicken was good. I was not a fan that it didn't come with the buttermilk as previous recipes had. Also - the instructions for the biscuits didn't work. They ended up flat.
I didn't like the chicken - it was not as crispy as I would have liked.
Very flavourful. Loved the salad!
Not a big pork fan but I am after this meal! A hit!
Food was great although a little low on volume.
yummy and add a bit of lemon juice helps enhance flavours
a bit bland for our family
"Recipe instructions wrong. The picture shows the chicken being dipped in buttermilk, and then dipped into the flour mixture. The recipe card says to add the flour to the bowl w/ the chicken and b.milk"
The garlic sauce was to die for.
I would add chicken to the meal
Was good just wished for more sauce
super flavourful!!!
"simple, and tasted great!"
"absolutely delicious. just wish it has a different style of noodle, a bit difficult to eat"
it was amazing thanks
taste was good ... texture bad. Everything was mushy.
Too much kale. Will add less next time.
The cucumber was mushy and not fresh.
Beef was VERY tough. Flavour was ok. Needed more ingredients.
Great taste and ultra easy to make.
"The Potatoes were terrible, we had to throw them out"
Excellent flavour
I would prepare the buttermilk ahead of time and let the chicken soak int the fridge for extr flavor. Also the instructions should read “roll the chicken in the flour” not “add to the buttermilk mix”
Didn’t like the millet
"I didn't use the kale, kale is nasty, rubbery stuff. But this was great without it."
Steak was very poor quality- beans and potatoes were good
"the mix for the chicken was ""gummy"". I followed the direction so not sure what happened. It didn't really get brown."
"Sundried tomato cap was opened and spilled, spoiling most of the meal."
We really liked this one but it wasn’t spicy enough for us so we added our own hot sauce that made the recipe much better
Out of the ordinary but I found the sauce rich and heavy.
Je n'ai pas vraiment aimé ! J'aurais ajouté un 2e pain naan tellement il y avait de stock.
Delicious
"This meal was barely edible. The cuts of chicken were poor, the coleslaw was so terrible, I took two bites before giving up. The biscuits were alright, but not good enough to salvage the meal."
"Horrible, the meat was horrible, didn’t eat it after we cooked it."
This cut of steak was VERY good.
Bland and needed more seasoning
The meat was very fatty.
This was my favourite recipe. I will definitely make this on my own in the future.
I think there was a step missing in the recipe. It wasn’t breaded at all like the pictures. It was wet and goopy. Cooked up ok flavor wise.
lettuce was limp by Thursday. Too much onion in the couscous (ratio seemed off).
"wow, outstanding"
Family enjoyed the chicken; did not enjoy the coleslaw as much.
"tasted very good, but the cooking times were way off 10 mins for a fast fry pork chop turns it to leather 4-5 mins is all it needs ."
"We loved the flavours and textures of this dish, and it felt healthy."
I’ve never done steak in the oven and was skeptical but it was amazing. will do it that way again. and I don’t love green beans but I did with this. well done!
"Bland, soggy, and proportioned weirdly. no flavour at all. Inedible"
Very good.
One of the best steaks I have had in a long time. Great sourcing of meat!
We have never had Middle East food but this recipe tastes very good to our surprise!!
was ok
The instructions were not very clear for breading the chicken. The biscuits were quite flat.
Meh. Chicken was tough in places. Why wasn't there dressing for the salad?
"Would have preferred spinach rather than kale, the kale doesn't cook up quite as well and is too strong."
"Was easy and delicious. Would have been better if I could have used the cucumbers that it came with but they were mush, possibly from being packed directly on the ice and frozen."
Overall a unique recipe but I think I would have preferred the flavours with rice instead
"Lacking flavor, we both thought it needed something else to take it to flavor town."
Not as tasty as all other recipes
loved it
Delicious. I can’t wait to make the pork chops again!
good
too much potato
a little bit too spicy; but really good!
"biscuit was too fluffy, buttermilk would’ve been better than mixing milk w/acid"
"simple, but tasty!"
yummy! I wish it was fully vegan. It doesn’t really make sense to have a « cheez » sauce but then have non-vegan pasta.
Hard to clean Bok Choi and unfortunately left the meal gritty and inedible.
Biscuits were blah and hard. Instructions for chicken made no sense - end up with very little coating and non-crispy chicken.
The salsa takes this up another level.
I think it would be better with spinach but it was still good
taste good although we found an error in the instructions.
Recipe needs to be fixed. I added the Kentucky breading to the bowl with the chicken and ended up with a gluey mess that didn't stick to the chicken. The biscuits were the consistency of pancakes.
easy to prepare and very tasty. best mesl of the week.
Loved this one especially the sauce!
Coleslaw dressing had too much mustard in it. Mix for biscuits used too much liquid so they were overly soft.
It was hard to strain the quinoa. I ended up accidentally pouring most of it down the sink. I ended up using store bought veggie patties instead of the recipe.
odd meal should have rice or beans or something
The slabs of cabbage always get so dried out :(
could have used a protien
Everything was good but the dressing for the coleslaw
Even the little one enjoyed this one!
I really liked this one. Nice alternative to mac ans cheese.
A simple dish with a well selected tomato sauce.
"These were FANTASTIC! Mind you, we did add a bit of chicken and extra cheddar. But fantastic nonetheless. We'll be making them again!"
Didn’t care for the Dijon for the coleslaw
So good!
Good . But it is a repeat.
steak was a bit tough but flavours were good. potatoes were especially delicious.
"k8nd of boring, could use some more spice or fat or something. (bacon?!)"
Lacked flavour.
Weve had this one twice now and its a favourite. this second time the chicken was a bit sinewy.
This was super quick!! We didn’t use all the noodles as it seemed like a lot for two.
The sauce was good and the beef was seasoned well. easy for my sons to cook but way too much chopping for them even at 13 and 22. Recipe definitely takes a lot longer for novices
excellent. We loved this dish. Great flavours.
"This is my all time favourite recipe from Chef's plate. I had never had Halloumi before starting to order with you guys. But this dish is my favourite, and i'm glad it's back for a 2nd time."
Pre cooked potatoes were not tasty and the meal was blend
"The Recipe turned out delicious but not complete, the mint was not included with the food bag."
Great chicken
mature flavours for kids. recommend a skip as a family meal. very good though...
Could use more garlic but otherwise was great!
"Cabbage mix was terrible, the mustard taste didn’t go well with it at all and barely edible. Biscuits tasted yummy and unique, but came out flat. Chicken was great, only one kid complained its Spicy."
Tomatoes were over ripe and some were like mush
Recipe steps not in order.
My order never showed up
We wanted more zest! Easy to prepare though.
Delicious! Loved this recipe. It was easy to make and had a ton of flavour. I would recommend lightly seasoning the wontons.
Delicious! I can't believe how easy it is to whip up the buttermilk biscuits. Big hit at my house!

"I think the easiest to make out of the meals I received, needed more flavour though, but overall enjoyed it."
very creative idea
this was good but not as exciting as the other new dishes.
Delicious! Would have been better if the broccoli was chopped up more.
Delicious!!!
Potatoes seemed a bit dry
"I didn’t care for the cut of beef, it had a lot of grissel (?) and was super tough to chew."
Good but small portion.
Not enough steak for 2 people. I had about 3 bites so that my partner could have an actual portion.
Tastey but not enough for 2 people
Delicious. Potatoes took a bit longer to cook
"It was great, a little too spicy although I put have of the spice in it."
Very delicious and good portion
Delicious!
Potatoes undercooked. Kale salad was sour
Delicious!
Too much dijon in the coleslaw. Needed more mayo
This was the best meal in our box and was still just Ok. We have noticed a real decline over the year with the quality of this service.
Not great fresh out of the oven but ok reheated in a frying pan
One of the best meals we've had. Very tasty.
Very tasty
"Very disappointing :( Lettuce was wilted and molding...had to throw out. Cucumbers were soft and not appetising. Pita was hard, had to throw away."
My 3 year old loves this meal ?? Thanks Chef's Plate ???
I was not happy with the chicken thighs. There was barely any meat on them and I feel like they weren't worth the money.
steak was a little tough
enjoyed this recipe but had the vegetable unit issue again. The card said 35 oz sweet potato - the bag delivered four small sweet potatoes at 20 oz. at other times I have had excessive carrots!
Basa was very mushy even though it was very fresh.
Tasted good but too small of portions
"Burger and spices was great, garlic sauce was great"
not enough breading!
Biscuit texture was not great. Dressing for Cole slaw was just ok.
Biscuits didn't rise
slice beef thinly
GREAT combo of ingredients and full of flavour!!
The pork and kale salad were good
it was tasty but portions are to small
Found the sauce in the cabbage a bit too spicy. But the sweet balanced nicely
Avocado was rock hard
What is up with the starches in these meals? Potatoes never cooked through and we’re inedible
Personally a bit too much lemon but otherwise good
"Biscuit and coleslaw were delicious, but why Chicken Thighs? This recipe used to be one of our favourites when it had Chicken Breasts, but the Thighs were very disappointing. :("
Didn't like the over the top lemony flavour at all
The chicken didn’t brown as nicely as I would have liked. Could be that I used too much oil?
Goat feta cheese made it taste weird.
Very good beef was smaller portion than listed.
Everything was good together but I found the burgers kind of plain on their own.
Huge hit with the family and so easy to get ready.
5th is was a super flavourful meal!
We didn't receive the vindaloo paste and this recipe was terrible.

Pretty tasty but I think it would taste better with additional sesame oil and sliced beef instead of ground beef.
This was my first dish from chefs plate and it was beyond my expectations! i hope this dish circles back again as I loved it. Great first impression!
Another winner for our family!
The chicken had turned before I had a chance to cook this meal (opened the vacuum sealed package and it had an awful stench to it!). So I had to throw it out and couldn’t cook the meal.
We really enjoyed this - it was our first meal and it was great!
the salad was a bit plain. I added my own homemade sweet potato fries to make the side dishes feel more substantial. I thought the burger looked small but the meet was actually quite substantial and had delicious flavour!
Very dry - needed more sauce.
The steak was not good. It did not seem fresh and smelled funny when we opened it. We could not eat this meal.
was very frustrated that Milk was not shipped with this recipe. I could not make the sauce because i did not have any milk. you guys always send the milk... until this time
Another veggie like baby corn would be awesome!
Would have served with a caesar salad! But burger is delicious!
"other recipes with milk have come with milk, so I wasn't expecting to need my own! the only milk I had was skim and it made the buttermilk very thin, the batter didn't turn out well at all :("
the greens were spoiled and the dressing was over powering with vinegar
"Loved this recipe!! So much flavour, simple directions, amazing meal, would definitely order again."
"Delicious chicken, great breadjng"
I was sent the wrong meat again. I received chicken thighs not ground chicken to make burgers.
Very happy with this meal; quite tasty and easy to make.
Maybe more veg?
the bbq sauce was alittle odd. not sure if I would get this one again.
cook broccoli first then add carrots after as they cook faster
the best meal of the week
"half of the sweet potato was rotten so portion cut down even more; pork chop was mediocre, very basic; roasted Brussel sprouts were ok, again, basic; chutney was good for pork chop (it needed the moisture as it was dry and tough). Basic meal and not good value for the price"
Disappointed butter was not included as per usual. Had to run out to store to purchase to complete meal - unusual - as it is normally included
butter not included for sweet potatoes. Instructions were unclear - see top of recipe where it advises to roast potatoes (when they are meant to be boiled and the question mark next to “add pork to sheet”
this one was my favorite! I could have eaten the 2 portion serving all in one serving! Hope to see this one again... maybe this summer!
"potatoes au gratin did not work out, too hard to get it right"
"Chicken and Biscuits were great, the slaw was yuck"
paper towel sticks to meat
delicious and easy to prepare
Best chefsplate meal we have ever had. Please continue with the Mediterranean cuisine!
"A little boring, again too much white flour in your limited vegetarian choices. Inexpensive ingredients. Would think twice about ordering pasta from you again."
It was sweet and creamy.
"This was good but super spicy, and was more “nachos” ."
cut of beef provided was very difficult to eat - extremely chewy
"I was not aware milk was needed so I had to make it a different day as I had to go purchase milk. The potatoes also did not look appetizing, they arrived in the sealed packaging starting to get grey ."
didn’t care for the sauce
Vinegar and mayonnaise do not make a dressing.

"i love this recipe! by far one of the best recipes put out, I’m glad to see it again ??"
the recipe didn’t give an oven temperature and the Dijon mustard the the salad dressing was very overpowering
This was absolutely delicious
we did not receive the written recipes
It was good - but pretty basic. That's what you get for the 15 minute meal though so still giving it 3 stars.
Good recipe but “Classic” buns were just step down in quality from usual ciabatta
"The flavours didn't work well together. We didn't like the Cajun spice in the biscuits, and the cole slaw was too mustard-y. We wouldn't order this one again."
There was not enough 'batter' to cover all the chicken.
"Not much flavour, had to add our own garlic and spices. Also not enough sauce to kale ratio, added additional tomato sauce."
Our favourite dish we've had with Chefs Plate!
Tons of flavour !
Needs more than 4 mushrooms and I was disappointed that it was dried pasta instead of the usual fresh pasta that Chefs Plate sends.
fish was way too flaky and really tasted awful.
Not worth paying extra to get the pre-washed kale and diced onion. There was plenty of time to do that while the pasta boiled.
would appreciate if recipe was more clear about both vegetables being in for 15min plus the additional 8min with the halloumi. maybe add total cooking time?
Just so so
So yummy!
"the salad was very fresh! potatoes were good. The steak had a lot of fat to remove, and wasn’t the most tender but it was very flavourful"
Less garlic in the sauce needed or suggested
Wow! My wife is Mexican and she was also very impressed!
The potatoes were missing from the kit.
YUMMMMMY!
biscuits had to much spice in them and the salad had too much Dijon both things were overpowered by the one ingredient
"the flavour was good, I would prefer more veggies, less noodles"
great flavours and easy to make.
"Taste was amazing. Took much longer than the time listed, but worth it."
"The cucumbers we received were soft and going off. Also, the instructions to put a moist paper towel in with the pita was not good. The paper towel stuck to the pita and I had to throw it out."
Easy to prepare easy instructions. Amazing dinner. Enough for 2 meals
Salad greens are always nearly rotten the same day receiving the pkg. I had to use alternate greens from my fridge. Burger is worth full stars though.
Steak was a little tough
Was good but only one small sweet potato didn't feed 2 people
way too spicy for my husband - he couldn’t eat it at all! would be better to give people options on how much green curry to add for varying levels of spicy ness
Sauce was very runny.
This recipe was completely flavorless and made way more difficult than it needed to be. I was also disappointed that it was made with ground beef and not beef strips.
I was disappointed to see that this did not come with fresh pasta as that is one of the reasons I choose chefs plate. Hopefully this is not the new normal.
delicious and easy
I made this the day I received my box and the cilantro was brown and going bad. The recipe itself was good but disappointed in the lack of freshness.
The dressing the salad is kind of gritty with the Parmesan cheese.
The coleslaw was awful. The flavor of the buttermilk buiscuits did not seem to go with the rest of the meal. The only thing that was good was the chicken.
I WANT MORE HALLOUMI
only used half the leak and no kale and added turkey kolbasa next time would break pasta before boiling
We really enjoyed this dish! However I’m deducting a star because the onion was rotten and we had to go out and buy another to make the dish.
"don’t like fish, put in beef = greatness"
Steak seasoning very flavourful!
Very nice. The pasta is a bit big making it difficult to eat
Really enjoyed it!
delicious!
I really loved this one-- such a delicious soup. Thank you for offering such wonderful vegetarian options!
Great flavours!!
absolute best chicken burger I’ve ever had! do not add any condiments
kind of bland
Basic recipe and simple to make. I cooked the steak a little longer because I prefer it more medium-rare to medium. It looses a star because there wasn’t enough steak for two people. Very small meat portion.
such quality meat!
Fresher buns/nan bread would have made this better. Also some of the veggies were not as fresh as expected
"We love this meal, second time ordering it. Delicious!"
"Steak is like a thick ribeye and takes 2x as long to cook, not a lean cut."
Needed thickening and a lot more flavour.
"Beef was good but rice became very clumpy, mushy and did not look like the photo."
I love buisquits! the whole thing was so easy.
Very good. Great texture and flavour. This one ranks high on our list of favourites.
Flavourless
"potatoes were hard, salad was awful pork chops were ok"
A bit spicy but good!
So so so tasty! Would definitely eat this again.

The food was yummy but there was one step in the directions that was a bit confusing. Step 3. 4th point down. It says to add the breading. So I added it to the buttermilk mix instead of dipping chick
Bland. Only 1 steak for two people??
potatoes did not get hot enough with 2-3 min of broil
"Slimey chicken, small portion"
This was so good and very easy.
"Un délice, on a adoré"
Would make this regularly
The brown rice was nasty
Not bad for a 15 meal. Mayo was missing from my bag so I didnt get the complete flavor. potatoes were good though
sauce was weird
Awesome
Really enjoyed the coleslaw!
Yummy
fish was mushy
"the biscuit batter was way too wet and they came out like cookies, the chicken didn't get crispy either but the flavours were absolutely great and we would definitely order again with a few tweaks"
"delicious, but not filling enough"
Yummy but made me poop.
"Flavorful steak, unfamiliar cut."
The salad was especially delicious!
Chicken did not crisp up; coating was gummy despite following recipe. The cabbage was a bit bitter.
amazing. only improvement is for the chicken to be less wet (very hard). patting it down with a paper towel does nothing. maybe just give more bread crumbs to help with wetness (and give it bite)
Lime and garlic was not inclouded with kit. So very bland.
Delicious!!!
Hangar steak best yet-other dishes with steak not so great.
Absolutely disgusting. The vegetables were rotten and the meal was not fit to eat
"Didn't get to try this, the chicken had gone bad"
needed garlic or spices. found bland. suggest smaller pasta.
"This was good. However, the rice was kind of weird. I rather cook my rice rather than have the rice pre-cooked."
"Needs more ingredients. We added rice, corn and beans and shouldn’t have to do that with a $20 meal!"
very tasty.
Delicious combination of flavours. The Caesar sweet potatoes were an unexpected blend but were so great we made them again on our own. The burgers were excellent
Tasty. Simple to make.
Delicious!!
breading did not stay on well and there was not enough
"There was potential, but the recipe wasn't as detailed as usual."
"Deelicious. I never would have thought to roast beans, but it's now my favourite way to eat them. And, the recipe's great hot or cold. Great for a picnic when the warm weather comes."
"Great, I loved the ricotta sauce!"
It was delicious!
"Quite enjoyed this, however I think chicken instead of beef would have given this recipe 4 stars"
Chicken and biscuits were delicious. Coleslaw needs some TLC
this was awful flavors didn't work for us at all
third time ordering it so I must like it
"The broccoli was disgusting in this recipe. It made my entire fridge smell awful! Also, the fish was to soft. I will not be ordering this ever again."
meat tasted weird. very gamey
Very good!!! I did not think i would like the sweet potato tex mex but it goes very well together.
This was so good - the steak was so tender :)
I really loved this bowl and the generous portions! My only complaint is that it was a little dry but I'm still rating it 4 stars considering I may have overcooked the turkey.
I'm only rating this a 1 for the chicken. The biscuits were inedible and the dijon in the coleslaw was extremely overpowering. I had to make a snack after this meal.
"It took significantly longer to cook the potatoes than stated, and there was too much vinegar in the salad dressing."
not enough flavor
not used to you not providing milk in the ingredients - we don't typically have milk in the house & didn't read the instructions ahead (our bad) but as a result made biscuits without...still not bad
Milk was missing from package. I used almond milk and the biscuits turned out nicely.
Very quick to prepare but a bit bland tasting
the Parmesan cheese was missing from my kit.
"In truth zero - we didn't like it at all - the thahini was solid which made the ""drizzle"" a blob - didn't matter how much i added to it."
I like spicy but these were blistering hot
We loved this recipe but for the chicken thighs. Not a fan so picked up some breast meat and loved it.
Not enough sweet potato “nachos”. Taste was wonderful but way too much topping to sweet potato ratio.
The chicken thighs were to fatty. I’d rather pay more for you to stick with chicken breasts.
"lots of flavor, turned out well. could have used naan or some kind of dressing for the greens"
Would be better w chicken breasts
the fish was sweet and melt in your mouth. the salad was very flavorful and appealing
Broccoli pieces were too big and didn’t get cooked and the meat took longer and had a meat watery residue that needed to be drained from the pan
This was easy and fun to make! I love the flavor in the Turkey and Carrot Fries!!! my healthy alternative!
Yum!
Didn’t like the sauce-
This was terrible - biscuits were the size of a personal pan pizza and flat - coleslaw had too much dijon mustard and then the chicken did not come out crispy - it was soggy and no coating.
Didn’t like the sauce. Wouldn’t order again
Okay. Too much spinach
"Potatoes are not good, need twice the time to cook and still raw"
One of favourites
"Was ok, not much flavour"
Great but the online description said chicken BREAST whereas it was chickenr thighs
basa was mushy
The wonton crisps were not very good; they were too crispy and thick and didn't feel like anything to do with wontons.
Steak has gone bad by end of week
Didn't get to eat them . Shipment didn't come until Friday all the food smelt rotten . Pissed
"This meal was AMAZING! There wasn’t a single thing left at the end. The sauce was delishous, kids and adults all devoured it and it was very simple to make."
"The potatoes weren’t very good, and the sauce/dressing wasn’t great. The pork chops were delicious ??"
"Meat was chewy, not good"
Delucioud
"for whatever reason, the chicken was not crispy at all"
Very yummy! More of this!
we didn't like this one at all
Everything was yummy but the chicken was in 6 small pieces instead of 2 full thigh pieces
"This meal felt a bit ""thin"". More humus would have made a difference."
awesome flavour
All -round delicious.
Didn’t care for this one at all! Fish wasn’t great and tabouleh was mushy.
"Didn't have as much flavour as other Chef's Plate recipes, still good, but not as good."
Loved this one! A fun spin on mac and cheese.
Good base of flavours but very dry...needs to be saucier
Always a hit
The chicken was delicious but the coleslaw and bisucuits were not. We ended up throwing them out.
"Spicy cabbage was odd, rest was good"
Carrot arrived soft and didn’t make it to the meal prep two days later. Had to be omitted from meal. Produce quality in the past few boxes have waned significantly. May need to reconsider service.
Yum!
I wasn’t. A fan of these. Not flavourful enough and fell apart
"Delivery driver left outside, all produce was frozen."
Home made hearty meal. Loved the biscuits
eliminated to bread and added green beans
Best recipe ever. Could have had a bit more meat though
Close to a three.
Sauce not wel received by family.
biscuits were the best part of the meal - absolutely delicious. the chicken was ok but I wouldn’t repeat the recipe and the slaw I could have done without
Ok but onion was rotten ! Only half was usuable
Totally yummy (although we substituted ground beef in place of the ground turkey)
Pretty good.
Delicious. Took a bit longer to make then explained.
Sauce was a let down
could have been more flavourful
Delicious
The recipe card was unclear at times and hard to follow
the sweet potatoe slices ended up very mushy so this ended up more like a stir fry sort of meal tasted nice but wasn’t so nice to look at
can’t make buttermilk out of skim milk. a suggestion to use whole milk should have been there. Or just send the buttermilk.
nice flavours! pasta and cauliflower covered with the spices meant you didn’t really know what you were getting in each bite - I love pasta but usually not a fan of cauliflower but in this dish it was delicious
Soooo delicious
I wonder if the turkey would have been more flavorful if we cooked the ginger with it? The ginger flavor didn't really come through when it was mixed into the plum sauce.
was a big disappointment. if i had the choice i wouldn't even give one star...too many issues to fit in this section but I want a full refund (plate credits)
Flavorful. A lot of slaw.
My kids loved these!
These were delicious! Unfortunately our tomato was squished in the bag though.
Loved this!
The beef was extremely tough and full of gristle it made the dish not enjoyable at all
Manquait de légumes (j’ai ajouté des tomates et avocats)
"Fantastic burgers, very tasty!"

I only used 1 garlic clove in the sauce instead of 2 and I found at 16 min the millet was still a little crunchy.
The garlic sauce was absolutely amazing & will now be a staple sauce in our future meals
Really good. Would be better if the pasta wasn't pre-cooked as it became overcooked very easily.
not a fan of the salad..
"Chicken didn’t look exactly like Pi cture, ut was still tasty."
Biscuits looked like pancakes. Cole slaw was lacking flavour. Chicken rub instructions were confusing as recommended mixing milk and coating together?
maybe some cranberries for the salad?
We found the beef to be tough even though cooked according to recipe & the sauce was not very flavourful.
"The chicken and biscuits were great for this, but the carrot was too large making the slaw disproportionate."
This was delicious! The garlic sauce made it!
delicious. would definitely make again and again.
steak was minuscule for 2 people
Would have been even better if I hadn’t burned the wantons. Spicy and delishish.
Loved everything about this dish and was very easy to make.
The meat didn’t turn out as nicely as in the picture. There was an overwhelming amount of carrot and not enough variety in the vegetables.
The ricotta vinaigrette was not what I expected and very good!
Wasn't crazy about the texture of the sweet potato in this recipe and also the patties didn't cook properly the got stuck and I had to break them apart... but he feta sauce was delicious!
didn’t like the millet - would have preferred couscous
The cauliflower made my fridge smell quite bad. And this was not my favourite recipe.
Was very filling.
Super easy to prepare. Delicious and filling!
"This dish surprised me, in a good way. Release any notions of mac n' cheese and enjoy this creamy, slightly spicy but delicious dish."
My kids loved this dish. I modified the spice level a tad so they could eat it. Will be making this one again.
salad had too much mayo
Potatoes require a little more cooking to warm them up than what the recipe card indicates.
cabbage was a bit old!
So quick and easy to make and tasted delicious. The whole family loved it. It was the only decent recipe we got this week. I will definitely make this one again.
Je n'ai jamais reçu mon panier ??
Portions were large. Great flavour
The size of the steak was ridiculously small.
Delicious!
"As far as stir-fry goes, this was a fairly simple recipe and easy to prepare. It was a bit bland however - it needed more spice or some 'kick' to it."
Chicken breading did not cover chicken. Would suggest either dredging or having more batter
Very good.
delicious
"The pork turned out really nice. Unfortunately, the cooking instructions for the potatoes was way off and the salad smelled really bad."
"Loved the nutritional yeast, it added a lot!"
Add chicken to it
Missing beef
"My husband will normally eat anything however he want able to stomach this. The flavour was odd, we like curry dishes however this was off"
Loved the chicken seasoning and couscous. The greens I received were a bit wilted.
"This was a great meal. Nice & spicy, felt like a treat (but healthier)"
it was just ok.
that was the best fish quality ever. good job.
The cut of meat was thoroughly unappetizing.
absolutely delicious
"missing ingredients from boss, could be why but burgers didn’t taste good"
The spice package came empty
"Don't like the pre-cooked potatoes - they turn out grey and still firm inside, even when cooked longer than suggested. Would prefer fresh."
Awesome
"not much flavor, meat very oily"
Expected more flavour
Tastes like medicine.
Very tasty and easy to make
The Dijon coleslaw dressing was a little too pungent. We did not eat much of it. Chicken and biscuits were fabulous
great flavours and very filling!
too spicy
Kid's loved the buns of course (-;
"There was too much mustard in the salad dressing..... a bit to spicy. The chicken and busicuits tasted fine, but there was something wrong with the batter on the chicken. It was far from crispy."
Right amount of Spice and easy to make
So tasty!
Really nice..
"Quite good except my avocado was overripe - only half of it was usable so there was not as much guacamole as we’d hoped. The taquitos were good, though!"
"Absolutely AMAZING flavour. I would love to see more dishes like this. The only problem was the pre-steamed basmati rice - it’s so messy to heat up in the big chunk, I get rice all over the kitchen."
Very tasty. Potatoes were not hot enough. Probably would have been better to preheat in oven for a while before turning on broiler. Kale salad was quite large and lots left over for lunch next day.
steak was incredibly tender
esta comida era sabrosa
one of my favourites!
good but not my favourite.
Steak was so tender! Delicious!!
both my husband and I loved the flavour. This one is one of our favourites so far
"Very tasty. Offer this again, please!"
Okay but lacks flavour
second time was just as great as the first
Awesome! So good my kiddo at some of my portion too!
Really good! Easy too!
Now that I am not at home I am second guessing myself. However I do think the recipe told me to add a bit of mayo to the salad dressing. Would have been better without
Not enough batter
"disappointed with the favours, very basic could have made myself without assistance from chefs plate"
"the flour bag bursed during delivery, it was quite a mess"
vinegar in packaging leaked.
Very easy and quick. Leftovers were even better!
Thai sauce was good & spicy. Directions said to cook the rice noodles way too long. Noodles came out really mushy. Should have cooked noodles & broccoli together at the same time for 2 minutes.
Had to buy extra halloumi as not enough for 2 people.
It needed more liquid than the recipe called for. Once I added more it was great
way spicier than anticipated
Excellent
Too spicy. Couldn't share it with my son.
Delicious!! Loved this one! Will definitely make it again one day! Didn’t miss the meat at all!
Not delivered
Carb count is higher than i would usually eat
Would have preferred some more variation in the salad. The chicken burgers were amazing!
"We prefer a well done steak, this one was a bit thick to cook all the way through"
"Very spicy, and felt the recipe was better with chicken breasts rather than thighs (which it has been in the past). Also, not including buttermilk felt a bit like a cost-cutting measure."
Steak much better than first time I tried it.
Family loved it and wanted more.
Don't cook biscuits on parchment paper (paper only up to 425 degrees recipe says 450) and it burnt :-( The breading didn't stay on the chicken (and I don't think I messed it up :-/)
The biscuits were not as awesome as I'd hoped. Not foul proof apparently.
Although they forgot a leek I enjoyed the meal.
beef was hard to chew
Phenomenal!!
chicken was tasty but quantity was tiny. biscuits turned to pancakes. was frustrating to need milk as we dont keep it at home. actually cooked on time though.
loved it!
This was one of my very favourite meals I’ve ever received from Chefs Plate. So easy and tasty!
tired of basa.
loved the sauce!
Not our fav.
Very flavourful. Even though we didn't know we needed milk (for the cheese sauce) and we rarely have milk in the house and didn't have any.
Flavour was good but potatoes were stodgy.
"Please start including butter, milk, and other staples in the kits. I don't keep these things on hand."
I was surprised I liked them so much. It definitely fulfilled my craving for nachos in a healthier way!
Everything about this meal was excellent
"chicken unfortunately had too much fat on it, not cut well, breading too moist so chicken was soggy. not a fan of the flavours of coleslaw or biscuits. this is by far the least favourite meal I’ve had"
delicious! great quality steak
Very enjoyable. Although I would use half of the garlic next time.
Small portion with only one sweet potato
"I sent an email about this already, but the recipe was unclear and led to a muddy/clay-like finish to the chicken, and the biscuits were flat. I imagine this recipe could have been quite good"
Fantastic. Would love to see a protein option for this
"Suggest including times for various meat preferences. ie. Rare, medium rare etc"
Tasted good but the chicken didn’t crisp up as much as the picture led you to believe it would.
The fish was perfect but the couscous was a little dry
The salad was very mustardy.
Do it gain!
Tasty and nicely spicy!
The coating on the chicken didn't work out.
more bland then the last time we had it.
"Kind of an odd dish, flavours were okay, but not great."
Love the garlic sauce
Kids liked it. I needed to add some additional spice to it.
Very nice. One of my favourite Veggie dishes
Did not like the texture of precooked rice
"Veggie dinner was excellent , It was flavourful and filling ."
The proportions were totally off for the biscuits. Dough was too wet.

The sauce was delicious! The cook time on the Millet was not long enough.
Love this quick vindaloo
"Basa tasted great and easy to cook, Millet came out clumpy and hard to toss in all ingredients, interesting mix of flavours, looks better then it tasted."
Love the ricotta sauce and the paprika potatoes. Would add some nuts to the beans next time for a little extra flavour and fat.
Really good but a few more calories than I'd have on a regular basis.
not enough dressing
Flavour was excellent. I would just fine chop the onions next time.
very tasty dish! I liked the size of the taquitos and the avacado sauce. the slaw was good too
Chewy steak. Just okay.
Never got my beef or the recipe!
could be more meat (especially since it is for two) but very delicious and simple to make

tasted great but the instructions had an error or two
the salad is always so welted
delicious however the cheese was much smaller than expected
"Good, but gravy turned out a bit thin. I added some thick coconut milk and that improved it a lot."
Taquitos were great but slaw was meh. Taquitos were filling enough though
missing soy sauce but otherwise good
"The steak was so fatty that it was inedible. I understand that rib eye is fatty, this was ridiculous. The salad came with no vegetables, so I had to add to it. The rest of the meal was good."
The meat portion on the small size
Too much kale given and the sauce didn't work at all for the dish.
A bit bland
"Steak and potatoes were both great, but the salad flavours did not go well today. Parmesan cheese made the dressing sandy. Shaved Parmesan would be a great improvement!"
The flavours were good. But the meat was poor quality. Horrible actually. We couldn’t even chew the meat it was way too tough. Such a waste. shocked and dispointed in the quality.
Tasted bland and dry.
Whole family approved!
steak was insanely tough to chew
"A bit spicy, but tasted like average quality food with sugary sauce. Rice doesn't cook as fast as directions say, needs more water."
Delicious and very easy to make!
coleslaw could use more flavorful dressing
We were missing the paella spice mix. I substituted Italian seasoning and the recipe was tasty.
Great!
needs more protein and vegetables
Excellent! Everyone loved this. Good flavours and healthy too
The veggie to noodle ratio in the 4-person recipe was off. We all ate but still had a huge container of just noodles as leftovers. Had to go by vegetables to steam to accompany them. Yummy flavour!
"pork chops were quite small, and one was much smaller than the other."
I wish I had known the bbq sauce was mesquite like. Not my favourite.
this dish would have been better with meat pieces instead of ground beef - otherwise it was tasty - we did not need to use all the noodles
"Absolutely amazing, great flavors, quick to serve. I will order this again."
Need more vegetables
"Great flavors, and good quality chicken tenders."
"The taste was good, but we found the steak tough for a ribeye."
a little spicy for my husband's tastes but we liked it anyway!
it seemed to lack flavour for me.
Salad very good.
Recipe had inconsistencies about the amount of water involved. Noodles were far too large.
Particularly yummy and easy
Delicious and so easy. Love the one pot meals. Could have done with a little more rice though.
"The sauce tasted a bit too diluted. Maybe less water next time, or more soy."
Had to add my own herbs because it was pretty bland
"Flvaours were good, but the produce wasn't great. Onion was rotten on one side and the carrot was rubbery."
"little spicy, and we prefer white meat, but overall a solid dish."
A favourite for sure. Would prefer a quinoa or other grain to the cracked wheat.
The steaks were so grissly and barely edible. My kids tried and tried but ended up throwing away almost all their steak. Very disappointing.
"The sauce for this dish was great! ingredients to combine seemed kind of odd, but ended up having great flavor."
Unreal recipe
Meat was very tough and had a lot of fat and sinew
Terrible.
"Very yummy, would have preferred less onion. Will try this receipe again with less onion, more sweet potato. The two small sweet potatoes were smaller together than the large onion in the bag, so.."
love this recipe. made it for lunch one day on the weekend. will make again
Tasted delicious. Was nice and easy to make. Love the fish recipes as I don't buy much fish on my own. Keep them coming!
not enough of the main part of the meal. left feeling hungry afterwards
The steak was terrible. :(
The veggies were great. I did not enjoy the chicken at all. I would have preferred chicken breast. The bits that I got were called tenders? they are the parts that I usually cut off and discard.
Very yummy! I’d omit the paprika from the biscuits as the smoky flavour took away from the delicious chicken & coleslaw - better for a fish dish pethaps
Garlicky and soooooo yummy!
just ok.
"Would recommend beef strips for stir fry and not minced beef. Also would not recommend the corn start, especially for minced meat. Made it too pasty! Took 60 mins. Delicious."
very delicious! never cooked with bok choy before! loved it
Cabbage was meh but the guac made up for it!
Dishes like these are delicious but I need vegetables i.e. more mushrooms would’ve been preferable!
"tasty, nutritious and colourful"
One of my favourites!!! Even my meat-loving husband LOVED it!
The salad was wilted right out of the bag. But the steak was fabulous.
"Burgers were delicious, but peppers were so hot/spicy, even after being de-seeded, that we found them inedible. Maybe because we let the pepper ripen too long? If so, that should be noted online."
Delicious flavor but much too hot/spicy for my family.
I liked it. It would have been good if they added corn to it.
It was okay? Think my husband over cooked the noodles
Broiled Potatoes and mayo rosemary dip were winners for me! Loved this dish!
This tasted ok but the portions were not big enough. I added additional arboreo rice and threw in some prawns to make the meal sufficient for a family dinner.
Okay for lunch but not a big enough portion for dinner
steak too chewy unless eaten raw and potatoes tasted off
Prefer to avoid wheat where I can and I noticed many of the dishes are including wheat compared to the past.
"Could have done with a tiny bit more sauce, otherwise delicious!"
"Poor quality meat, mostly tendons and fat. “Pre-washed” salad was definitely not washed, most disappointing Chef’s Plate thus far."
But to plain tasting.
Lots of food and a very easy and delicious meal!
"This one was amazing, would do this again"
One of my favourite!
Very tasty a little spicy
"An okay soup, feels like it is missing something."
Nice winter soup.
"The tomatoes that came with the meal were so mushy I couldn’t even use them for the recipe. I made this meal first, it’s disappointing to receive such poor quality produce. The slaw was not tasty."
A jar for the diced tomatoes would have been much preferable to 4 individual packets.
Delicious. I added chickpeas to make it a bit more robust.
Needwd more cheese
Meh. Flavours were spot on however ground beef in s fresh stir fry seems like a cost-cutting measure....strips of sirloin or something would’ve been better.
Lots of dishes but worth it.
The potatos turned a little grey.
Delicious. Should give direction to snap pasta in half before cooking since the noodles are long.
Delicious!!!!
Too spicy but yet bland
Steak always seems to have a lot of fat in it
Tasty and easy. Lots of noodles!
original and intersting
bok choy still gritty after washing
Steak was mostly fat
Too spicy for me but my husband and son looooved it.
Really enjoyed the Vindaloo. Nice flavours and spices.
"Meal was good, but not enough sauce for quantity of ingredients."
"Meat had gone bad, so had the pepper and spinach looked old"
Just ok
Very poor quality beef! Almost inedible
Very good
Excellent
recipe said it was fresh mafalda pasta which it was not - received dry lasagna noodles
Needed more veggie
Surprisingly bland.
Took much longer than expected.
Delicious!
Spicy!
Flavour was good. Lots of apples and sweet potatoes but I didn’t really feel there was enough Brussels sprouts for 4 people. 17 Brussels split isn’t very much
I was surprised this recipe was a bit bland
sooooo good. I could have eaten 2 burgers myself!
Excellent both dinner and lunch.
not enough sauce and the last 2 parts of the instructions where written wrong (the pasta water part)
The flavours were very good. I chose to chop the chicken into smaller pieces and simmered it longer in the vindaloo for more flavour.
Cheese not included
The quality of the steak was horrible but the recipe itself was great
"Potatoes did not cook properly in specified time, steak was gristly and fatty. Overall, I'm disappointed by the quality of your 15-minute meals and will avoid them in the future."
Lack of flavour
Spicy pepper not disclosed
Fabulous!!
delicious and really easy to make
"Very good, great flavours"
Amazing and super quick!
Bland
"Delicious, and pretty quick to assemble too."
"Always with the halloumi, it seems we don't get enough for 2 servings. Following the directions to slice 1/4 inch, we got 3 slices, total. Apart from that, it was very tasty."
"the avocado was small and completely unripe - luckily I had one available. Otherwise, a tasty recipe."
Burgers were delicious.
Not a fan of the smoky BBQ sauce so next time I would substitute sweet Thai chilli sauce instead.
Delicious flavour! Large portions
"Avocados were hard as a rock. I had to use my own, which I was lucky to have. Otherwise the recipe was good."
"Was unsure when I ordered this, but we both loved it. A definite do again!"
This would have been amazing but my steak was full of visible gristle that was inedible. I was very disappointed at the amount of meat that I had to waste. Flavours were really good though.
"Tastes great, but if a recipe calls for butter, it should be included"
Delicious meal. Instructions should have included more stirring
Super kid-friendly. Felt it wasn't as flavorful as other recipes.
A bit watery
salad was basic
Cracked wheat was tasteless .. not a pleasant addition
I don’t agree that “poblano” peppers are a “mild pepper”! Roasted them as recipe said but used minimal amount of them.
"pretty basic, but yummy. added extra mushrooms"
sumptuous
Yummy!!!
Quality of chicken was questionable.
Delicious
people should be aware that the sauce is smoky. There should be more box choy
Balsamic reduction would be good on the Brussels sprouts but still good without
Way too spicy
we've had this before and always love it!
Great beef and veggies

"We enjoyed the potatoes & salad but the beef was, once again, tough despite having been prepared according to the recipe. Will not be ordering any more steak- based recipes as a result."
tasted like hamburger helper
Great trick so the avocado mash hadn’t browned for the sencond night
Would’ve been better if cheesier
"Salad dressing was too watery, but still tasted good"
Like this one the most so far
I felt that the ratio of pasta to sauce was too high. I added an Alfredo sauce.
Delicious!
Loved these burgers. They were very flavorful.
Poor cut of meat. Having a better cut would make it much better
says fresh pasta but it’s not. it’s dried
"So so spicy and we love Thai food, unable to eat"
Steak a little fatty
Excellent - my teenager looked or the leftovers for his lunch - none to be had!
"Garlic was to be fresh It was old and soft, Pepper was soft as well But over all when I used my fresh ingred it was good"
chilli in both sauces was too spicy
way too spicy! almost inedible
TASTY
Good recipe but not enough for two people
My order was missing a lime :(
More Halloumi in the recipe...but also more halloumi based recipes!!!
We found that the serving size was a bit small. We were very disappointed with both meals.
"The fresh chow mein noodles are always a hit, the sauce was surprisingly delicious!"
we loved this dish yumm yumm
Prefect amount of spice and flavor. The salad was delicious my husband and I both give the salad 4 stars!!
Used only half the curry spice and was still quite spicy. Not very flavorful though.
Fantastic! The whole family loved it.
We thought the beans weakened the taste of the rice. The meal was bland and one of the chicken breast packages was smelling contaminated so we had to go out and buy our own chicken for the next meal.
Loved the potato salad. My 6 year old didn't like the beef burger for some reason. The Caesar dressing was missing from the bag so we used ranch.
Delicious sauce!
My least favourite this week. Tasted only like curry. Salad arrived rotten and onion was mush. Received credit for needing to go and buy my own replacements for meal. Love the garlic sauce though.
Have not had this meal yet
Really enjoyed this one
"sauce looked gross before it was cooked. tasted ok, nothing special. really liked the snow peas though!"
We did not enjoy this meal at all. We learned that we do not like millet- for us- bad texture and no real taste- the sauce stuff was too strong flavor wise.
Absolutely amazing. Will be making again.
not a fan of the taste. had to throw the second meal away
Delicious and CRAZY easy to cook!!
Never got the opportunity to make it because my box was not delivered or stolen.
"Ok, pretty plain"
This was not a favourite of mine. The sauce was horrible:(
Dijon dressing was not good.
Dry biscuits and chicken didn't seem breaded.
"I thought the kids would love this but the taste was very flat, almost no flavor at all."
Flavoured biscuits not as good as past biscuits.
A little more spicy kick needed in the patty but otherwise amazing
Chicken was bad (very foul smelling after opening it only 3 days after delivery) And we learned of the policy where Milk was no longer being included. Which was never mentioned to us. Really unhappy.
Bland
Excellent recipe. Will be added to my regular rotation!
A massive hit with my family!!!
I found the recipe lacked flavour and not colourful enough on the plate.
"biscuits were great, chicken was bad and kids didn't like coleslaw at all (way too much dijon)"
Great
needed a lot more sauce to add flavor
I would order this one again
Using the vinegar and milk to make buttermilk didn’t really work.
A bit much mustard in coleslaw
"Good flavor but had to eat with a fork as the sweet potatoes are too soft compared to chips, and I had sliced them thinner than the instructions."
"Chicken was good, but did not like the biscuits or salad"
Very good - although your cooking time was way under what was necessary for the rice.
Not good
The amount of sauce provided was not enough for the portions of rice and turkey provided. Could have used one other ingredient to add a little more depth! I added some cheese and cherry tomatoes.
required milk and i don't keep milk in my house
"The beef was tough, it was Ok but not my favorite, I prefer the 30 minute meals, so should have ordered those."
could have had more sauce
More Humus would have been great
The dressing was too sour and the chicken steps were complicated
????
That was so delicious!!!
Terrible. Please see my email I sent back directly regarding this meal
Breading wasn’t the best.. chicken was more greasy than anything else.
Super easy to make and very tasty. I loved the spices on the chicken and the portions were enough for myself and two friends! You feel good after eating something so healthy and tasty like this.
pork turned out a bit dry
The dressing in my the slaw is as bitter ..: not sure if it was the cabbage or the dressing !!
"Very easy, and surprisingly tasty, I made a few modifications to the recipe, but that garlic sauce was delicious."
Flavours were great. Preparation was easy. But salad was rotten and unusable.
takes longer than expected to cook but all ingredients are fresh
not enough meat
Potatoes looked a little sad and leftoverish. coule have used mkre spices besides salt and pepper. the cut of meat was not good at all. i cut in half to serve and my half was almost entirely fat and gristle. and our piece was too thick to cook through to med-rare before charring the outside on recommended heat.
"We liked this very much, and will make it again on our own as it was very easy to prepare."
"Overall we really enjoyed this weeks recipes. This one again was on the small side portion wise but the flavours were excellent. I do not like the recipes online, prefer the printed cards."
"portion size too small. chewy steak, too much fat. bland meal overall"
"Ordered accidentally but was tasty, just kinda basic."
outstanding in all ways
Very good but I added a bit more of my own sauce
Delicious flavors and perfect little side salad
Couldn’t even eat it! I
cabbage slaw was terrible. The fish were pretty good.
Delicious! It was a bit spicy for the kids but I loved it and the feta was an incredible touch!
"Everything tasted great, and was well-proportioned. however, there was a mistake and I didn’t get any garlic for the guacamole, but luckily I had some at home!"
The order did not include the menu card. Account holders should have online access to a menu card. Email the instructions the week the order ships
Our whole family loved this one. Even our little ones enjoyed it despite the spice.
not enough vegetables to much pasta
"Burger was great, salad was so-so."
Why was the cabbage shredded? Every time that I've gotten a vegetable it is left whole/ or is sliced in half. There are more chances of contamination if vegetables are cut up.
did not like the flavour
The base of the dish is delicious but we thought the sauces overpowered the other flavours.
Spicy but bland
ground beef in a stir fry is gross
really big portions
this was a definite favourite!!!
Great but a little spicy- too spicy for my kids to eat.
Wonderful mixture of flavours and textures. A keeper!
"Chicken was okay, but food did not blend. Alll in all mediocre"
"This is a variation of a chowder recipe from Chefs Plate a while ago, but without celery. The celery-onion-carrot mixture is an important flavor for authentic chowder, so this was missed."
Added panko crumbs to patty and fried mine instead of baking tho.
"Meat was all gristle, potatoes burnt outside mushy inside, I actually want my money back the meat was so bad"

EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED in this meal. I have been using this service for over 3 years and have never received dry pasta. i was shocked to find no fresh pasta which has been the standard. Rip off.
"I picked this meal on a whim and it was one of the best things I've ever made! I will 100% cook with Halloumi again, thanks for introducing me to this awesome ingredient."
A little bland
A little too spicy for me
This was one of my all time favorites. I would love to see more bowls like this.
Would definitely get this recipe again. Loved the Apple chutney on the pork.
"Potatoes were very brown. Steak was ok, not a great cut."
Good portion was small though
Pleased the whole family! Added salted butter for the rolls
Lacking something in the taquitos - a bit dry
"The recipe was delicious, the chicken however had to be replaced"
produce was terrible!
YUM!!!
"Not much body. Could use some chicken, or meat of some kind"
The chicken smelled a bit bad when I opened the package; the burger kind of just wound up tasting like a hot dog
Best recipe ever!!!
"Good, I would order again."
Please include more veggies! Cabbage and minimal tomato is not actually a serving of vegetables.
The protein portion is less but the taste is on point.
Fish was very good!!
Potatos need more cooking time and steak was tough
This dish was a winner!!
Wonderful. Will make this again.
Really tasty.
This one is a keeper
This was good but unfortunately the spices listed in the recipe for the Cauliflower was missing. This is the second quality assurance issue we have had with chefs plate in the last two months.
"Excellent flavor, easy to prepare and quite a bit spicier than expected."
"Expected more flavor and not quite enough sauce for the rice. Other than that - good,"
not a great steak. Too much fat. Neither my husband nor myself finished our portion
"The avocado was not ripe at all and near impossible to mash. We ended up having the dish as a taco, didn't see the need to wrap them into taquitos."
this recipe was very spicy!
Awesome! Hearty
"Way too spicy for my family, recipe gave no indication that it was spicy"
"This was the spicy dish, the chicken vindaloo was awesome! I typed in the vindaoloo in erro"
"Noodles were mushy, too spicy for me,"
"Missing ingredients, steak was tough but was flavorful."
It was good just a bit too spicy! I would have appreciated a clearer not or maybe alteration to the menu to modify the spiciness. My husband loved it though!
"Texture was a bit weird, soup was too runny, and not enough taste overall."
Absolutely delicious. We will be making that recipe again!
"Edible, and filling, but I really didn't like the sauce."
Way to spicy
needed something additional in the wrap. Still good though
the sauce for the salad was too mayo based. I also didn't get the rice vinegar for the dressing but that's okay. I used olive oil instead and it was still very good.
Didn't mind the food but it was certainly nothing memorable or exciting.
Weird mix of flavours.
I think the recipe had a misprint - didn't come out looking anything like the picture and was more of a soup than a stir-fry.
I find that following the instructions exactly for steak recipes like this one leave them very rare where it’s not safe to eat.
Couldve used a saucyier recipe
veggies did not work out for me were dry and floppy
Beef was a little too fatty
"Terrific, ready quick and tasted great!"
"Chicken was bad, so was not able to use. Last week the chicken, carrot and cabbage were all bad."
The meal was good but the Buns that you sent were very small and stale
I added sesame oil and it had more flavour
Quality of steak could be improved
Good - would prefer leaner hamburger.
Not enough flavour.
Recipe was good but I really miss the fresh pasta. Please bring that back. I would be happy to pay more for it. That is what made the pasta dishes worth it.
Very good
We loved this meal. I was confused about the 1/4 cup of pasta water. It never mentioned on the card what to use the water with.
Pasta noodles were not fresh. Not much flavour.
i never would've attempted this if it hadn't been in a packaged form. Delicious.
"10 stars, absolutely loved it"
"Was very good, was a little bland but I added extra spices"
"it was ok, buger was tasty but not quite enough to eat."
"it was ok, but I wouldn’t call it “chow mein”, it’s more heavily BBQ sauce flavoured."
an ingredient (either spice or cheese) caused upset stomach
Delicious
The potatoes were awful. They came prepackaged. I like when you send fresh potatoes
Delicious
"the salad good. Chicken was near impossible to pull out of it's packaging (very sticky), had an odd smell, and when I 'patted it dry' with paper towel I lost a lot of meat because it was so goopy."
The spices were missing from the recipe so not as tasty as I’m sure it was meant to be
"Seems like a lot of noodles, a bit too many."
"Very tasty, but the leek was missing from my ingredients."
Needed more veggies
Just ok..
This was awesome
Too much bbq flavour for our liking
Enjoyed the unique flavours
My wife found it spicy but I loved it.
Excellent green curry
Excellent! Very tasty.
Not enough vegetables
Awesome
Spicy!!
LOVE it! our favourite of all we’ve tried.
"I found this to be on the bland side. Had to add bacon and ham for some protein and extra flavour. Instructions did not feel complete, asked to reserve 1/4 cup of pasta cooking water and that was it."
"steak was very poor quality, lots of grizzle"
chips don't crisp us real well - bun might be better
"This was good - the potatoes were just meh though, I would have preferred more seasoning!"
This was so good - I love a bean free chili recipe and it packed some heat!
Everyone enjoyed it.
"Excellent, very tasty. Loved the chutney"
Too much spicy. No other flavour. No one could eat it
It was delicious but we cooked on Saturday and the Halloumi was moldy so we had to dispose of a portion of it :(
"This recipe was also delicious but the recipe was unclear about where to use reserved pasta water, and the volume of warm water to be added was different than the reserved water volume :( Misprint?"
Way to much ginger
So much flavour. We all loved this. And loved the variations.
Flavour was great. Found the Kale very tough or grainy.. personally would use Spinach if i were to make this on my own..
Great flavours! The cabbage slaw was a little too vinegary for me.
Not crazy about this one
Too much spice
"This was one of my favourite recipes in a long time. The lime, bbq Asian sauce and the noodles were so good together! I hope to see this one again."
I added a few more vegetables for my family.
"Was missing lime in my bag , had to run out to grocery store !!!!!"
Good but missing the depth of flavours you get from a curry normally.
"It was not excellent, but it was not mediocre. Would do a different sauce. The smoky bbq sauce didn't give a good taste."
"Not the most exciting dish, but still good. It tastes even better as leftovers - and with extra salt."
Tomatoes could have been fresher
"Too spicy, just not enjoyable"
What happened to fresh pasta?
needs more spices!
Don't do a beef dish like this if you don't (can't afford) AAA beef. The amount of grizzle we pulled our of our mouths destroyed the meal.
Your halloumi cheese recipes never disappoint
The snow peas were rotten (before the date they were supposed to be good until) the rest of the dish was good
"Lettuce wilted, chicken had a terrible smell, was worried it was spoiled"
Loved it. I added a few more veggies because I love veggies but didn’t need to at all. However when I did there was still enough sauce and flavour. Outstanding.
Lacked a bit of flavour
Usually fresh pasta - not this time :(
weird taste
This was a 15 min meal - and the pre-cooked potatoes were grey and soggy. they looked and tasted terrible - we did not eat them. the steak was very grisly and was less quality than i'm used to
Very good
Lots of food. Was delicious.
Excellent flavour; I would not have thought of using Old Bay seasoning for this recipe.
Bland
delicious!
so good!
I would bake the brussel sprouts separately next time. The sprouts took longer than the recipe states. Delicious when finished!
Quite yummy! Definitely a comfort food. Was missing flavour the first night. Had more the second day
Too spicy which overwhelmed all other flavors.
better with sliced beef steak
"Really sad, meh, chili/salsa - should not be east as the whole meal. This is a side dish and NOT worth the extra money. If anything, this was a scam, this should cost LESS than the normal dishes."
Yummy burgers!
"cant rate this one, an error was made, did not get it, but was looked after"
loved the spice
"the smokiness of the bbq sauce really made this dish sing, I was sure what to expect at first but as soon as we tasted it we loved it!"
"even though this was a repeat it was very good, the dressing for the salad is incredible tasting even though it’s only 3 ingredients."
Had to buy my own carrots - the two I received were so soft I could bend them. Recipe itself was good.
we were missing one ingredient - white wine vinegar (fortunately I have some)
"Really good, excellent flavours in the sauces. The Halloumi adds a lot!"
Yummy burgers - the buns were super small though.
"C'est excellent, mais portion un peut trop petite"
Came out soupier than I expected. I was hoping it would be thicker. The flavors were really good
"Not too many strong flavours here, but delicious!"
So delicious!
bun was less quality than used to with meals. Salad also not the best
Great
Could have ate a second one.
"unfortunately, there was a lot of gristle in the steak and the meat was very chewy."
This was our first Chef’s plate meal and I’m sorry to say it was a big disappointment. The flavour combination of barbecue sauce and tahini just didn’t work for us.
Delicious! More than made up for our first fail.
Manque de sauce et pas beaucoup de goût
Disappointed that the recipe called for fresh pasta and we were sent dry...
loved this! I added an extra sweet potato as the two that were in my delivery were very small.
Missing salad
"loved the mushroom flavour, didn’t enjoy the creamy sauce"
This was not a good dish
This was awesome. Way better than chow mein.
Steak was chewy. Potatoes and salad were great.
Huge portion
We liked it...found it very spicy
very good
"Good taste, but the pork was small by the time it was trimmed."
Not very tasty
The carrot was so old that it could be bent without breaking the beets were soft
My child didnt like it :(
we liked having a quick steak option it was delicious
"Creamy garlic lime sauce sounds lovely. The actual sauce was bbq sauce, tahini ans soy sauce. The bbq sauce was over powering and didn’t fit. The Smokey flavour from the bbq sauce was super weird."
Amazing!!! Will def make again!
Was missing the apricots and the salad was wilted.
Not up to the standards of other Chef's plates we have had. Pretty awful.
"this was super bland, and a lot of work. couldn't taste the ginger at all"
Way too spicy :-( could not even eat it... My boyfriend is going to have this for lunch and dinner for the next few days!
More sauce
very good but a little too spicy
Minced chicken went bad prior to the BB date. Could not make this meal
my favourite of the group. lots of flavour and filling
Spinach was rotten
even with half the curry it was to spicy
Very good.
Steak is very tough! Please let us know what kind of meat you are sending!
This was outstanding! Love the cauliflower seasoning and the halloumi was delicious
This recipe could be a bit spicier
Yikes! Way too hot for my kiddos. Too much noodle - need more veg.
Amazing!
Just the right amount for two. Flavours could have been interesting but I found the tahini sauce overpowered everything else.
dough was salty
"I don’t like beets, so I didn’t use it."
meals were great however no recipe cards was a huge inconvenience
Could use more flavour
excellent flavour and simple recipe.....
"A little on the sour side, will add less lime juice next time. No issues with chili."
tasty but meat was very grisly which was disappointing
small portions
Was surprised it was ground beef. Would have been better with steak strips.
Too much kale and not enough mushrooms
would have liked chicken breasts better than thighs and I think it would have been great with pita bread!
we got the wrong ingredient bag so don't really know what it was like
"Cabbage slaw is just a lazy & cheap excuse for a salad, disappointing. The taquitos were tasty"
We really liked this meal. Wished to have a few more tomatoes next time. We saved some and sliced them thin for on the burger which tasted great
Nice taste but it could have been a bit more creamier.
"good portions, would like it more spicy and add sesame oil"
"Waaay too spicy. Like, painfully so, and I wasn't expecting it."
delicious
Sooooooooooo tasty
Lovely combination of flavours. It was a healthy hit at our house!
Never received the box...no help from customer service. They blame everyone else but their courier service if your box goes missing. Becareful using chefs plate.
"Good, not great."
my fault! didnt notice it was chicken thigh instead of breast and im jut not a fan of thigh meat :)
Really liked the flavors of this recipe! The poblano peppers were a nice spicy topping.
"So quick, easy, and delicious! Would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a quick meal that is healthy and full of flavor."
"Amazing flavour, great spice level."
sent chicken cutlet instead of ground chicken. Could not make
"Enjoyed the simplicity of preparing the selection of ingredients without having to ""find/get"" them. Would probably have liked a higher ration of meat with the noodles. Flavours not quite ""right"" ."
This was yummy!!
Would have this again!
too spicy
there needs to be a spicy rating on each recipe. this one had some heat for us and we found it kind of hot!!
Way too spicy! There should have been a warning. Neither of us could eat it and ended up throwing it out. I have paused my subscription as a result - too expensive to be throwing out a meal for this reason
this was very tasty
"Not thick, wasnt very enjoyable"
My all time favourite!
Should have been really good but the flavours where underwhelming.
The lime was almost rotten so the guacamole was very disappointing.
"wayyy too spicy, but a good recipe!"
Way to small of portion. Had to add to it. Overall flavour pretty good though.
I had never worked with ground chicken before. This was simple and delicious. I added a few slices of avocado to mine and aioli.
This is my favourite recipe. The flavours are bold but so nicely balanced. This is a total home run.
"not as creamy as I expected, but still pretty tasty"
awesome ! wish i could have had another!
simple but delicious!
I usually don't choose vegetarian recipes and I am so happy I did - this was delicious.
very tasty! need a very large pan as it is a huge amount of kale to wilt. nice mild but fresh flavour
bland
Very good
Excellent! Us and the kids loved it!!
Inspired me to serve it at friend's upcoming birthday. Fingers crossed they like it as well as I did!
I got very little potato and carrots with this recipe
The steak was not a good cut. Very fatty. We order twice a week and this is the first tine we were disappointed.
Soo good! We love the bowl type dishes (Budda bowls)
A little to spicy
Would have liked more or a bigger carrot to be provided. The one small carrot that was provided went limp before I was able to make the recipe. It also turned out a bit watery
did not get the cheese
easy to make and very tasty
My daughter LOVED this. Completely devoured it.
the beef in this recipe was very tough and we couldn’t eat it. I cooked it exactly following the recipe and it was medium rare but it was terrible. sorry...I think it was just the price we got
i roasted my sweet potatoes instead of boiling them! it was yummy
This recipe was not worth the money. Not enough ingredients for a substantial meal
Missed having meat with this one but it was delicious!
to spicy
Great taste but veggie to pasta ratio was lacking. Ingredients do not match what we paid for the meal
Salad dressing > gritty. Something wrong with the parmesan?(inedible) Beef had thick vein of yellow (pus?) running through it. Never seen anything like it. Almost threw up. Whole meal went in trash
Not good. Thai recipes usually a miss
Flavour was good. Chicken breast would have been nice instead of ground.
"The cleaning of the kale was a lot longer than planned, and the sauce was a bit low on quantity, so we just adjusted the amount with other stuff at home. The taste was good though."
Meat was moist. Great Chutney recipe
"The flavour wasn't quite right... Still tasted good, just wasn't what I expected of a good paella dish"
Very spicy but good
"I liked the stir fry, but didn't really like the salad - didn't like the dressing so much."
"We added shrimp, but found it lacked flavour so added roasted garlic, basil and sundries tomatoes."
Recipe said fresh pasta but it was dried.
Sauce didn’t work out as expected
Needs more flavour and ingredients
"Easy, flavorful but not enough food for a sustainable meal. Fine for a lunch only."
This recipe was also good. We added some more garlic and extra old bay seasoning but other than it was tasty and easy to make.
tasty dish would make this again
it was ok. would likely be better with strips of beef as opposed to ground.
Did not receive this recipe
Please repeat this meal! It was fantastic! Our favourite chefs plate yet.
Mon mari a trouvé ça épicé mais les enfants et moi avons adoré !
Préparé par ma fille de 14ans et delicieux!
We really enjoy this dish.
It was bland.. felt like it needed some other spice.
Great flavour.
Moist and delicious
Steak was very fatty/gristly
Surprisingly good. Needed a bit more flavour to it but otherwise a nice idea.
"Flavour base was great, would prefer different vegetables better suited to a vindaloo, such as peppers, cauliflower, zucchini rather than so many carrots"
So tasty and super simple!
Very good but quite spicy.
Ribeye was not a great cut.
Quality of meat was not good. Too much fat
Delicious! Recipe was so easy to make!
A bit thicker gravy?
Husband thought too spicy
Je n’est pas aimé la sauce d'accompagnement
Fantastic! adjusted the cook time on the steak as we prefer medium and not rare steak.
More veg would be better. The thighs had lots of gristle
We were very pleased with this dinner.
Recipe was confusing
"flavor was a little bland, cheese helped a little, overall not bad"
Best meal we've had so far. Flavor profile was amazing. We each ate 2 bowls. Going to have this again in the future
Maybe I messed up the noodles.
Very bland
"The apple chutney was a nice option that I have never had before, very good!"
Recipes were tasty. Only 2 stars because I received empty and spilled ingredients as well as missing pork. Onion was moldy too.
Delicious but small portion of steak.
"It was yummy, but very spicy!"
Wonderful!
good flavour.
Steak was very tough
Bland
BBQ sauce taste not good in chow mien. .
burger was super super delicious!
Great flavour but sweet potatoes were small and old
sauce was a little weird
Worst dish I have ever had from Chefs plate
It was great
"This meal tasted wonderful. I wasn’t a fan of this noodle style, it was a little hard to eat!"
"The pork was the hands down fav, followed by the chicken and the ragu"
Great flavors. Loved the salad toppings and the salad dressing was AMAZING
"fish was excellent, the red cabbage slaw was bland, needs something more"
Avocado that came was spoiled.
a little hot!
Fantastic!
Very tasty
"Not a fan of chicken thighs, would have preferred chicken breasts."
"Recipe was very tasty, there is just not enough for a family of 4 (2 teenagers)."
I really loved the burgers but would have preferred it with potato wedges
Very good and easy too!
Ingredients were not as fresh as usual
Loved it. Wish I had more. Great flavour and nice amount of heat. Lots for quantity as well
"too noodle forward, vegetables not prominent and edamame got lost in the dish. The green curry left the dish one note and too powerful (we didn't use much) - would only give a half star out of four"
Outstanding! Added a garlic mayo on the bun as well.
I am rather disappointed in the way chefs plate has gone with their packaging. The containers and bottles used were so much easier and you could reuse them for so much. Now most stuff you can't reuse
Just the right amount of spice.
I am having digestive problems and was way just too spicy- couldn't eat most of it.
It was good. We don’t like mashed sweet potatoes so we ended up roasting them instead.
Liked the ingredients but again too spicy. I am seeing a specialist this week because part of my pancreas is not working so although I embrace the concept don't feel any further orders are any usenow
Flavour was amazing but the steak was a bit tough...
Spicy
Not flavourful
"The salad and potatoes were great and had loads of them. The steak, however, was stringy and hard to cut. The pieces that were edible easily had good"

"That she’s kind of made it all stick together and clumped up, however it still tasted great"
The meat is usually really good but this one was very chewy.
delicious!
Delicious!!
"Easy and good enough, but did not get much mushroom or cheese. Mostly kale."
"The recipe didn’t call for much water, which made it stick to the pan. Otherwise it was good"
Not as spicy as anticipated but tasty
Did not receive meat
Worst steak ever!
Everything tasted great. Pork portions were too small and the mashed potatos were too much wirk. Delicious but won’t order again.
Too much ginger.
Will have to have this again
I didn’t get to make them because the meat that was sent was spoiled. Slimy and smelled awful
Amazing loved it
Too many tendons in the steak
This cut of steak was so terrible. It's the last time we will order a steak plate.
too spicy
Soooo good!
A little bland
"I was surprised at the ground beef. Thought it would be cut of steak , it was food though"
Lots of flavours
Seemed to require more cream or liquid. Very small volume of sauce compared to pasta
I did not realize that I would have to pull off the leaves and wash very very well. The bok choy was sandy! My fault for not washing well enough. The dish was quite tasty.
Cheese was really thin and buns were boring
Succulent et sans viande
Loved this meal! It was flavourful Nd filling!!
I baked tortillas cut up as chips to add to the chips we gother and they had a much better texture and taste than the chips sent with the meal.
the zhug sauce was missing
Way too spicy.
yummy!
"We did not use the red chilli pepper, we are not fans of that heat, so we tossed it out. So no worries on the recall for us."
The Dinner and the Lunch Salad were excellent. Great portions
very good
"Good flavour, but the cut of steak was poor."
"Portion VERY small, not enough for two people."
I'm finding the quality of some vegetables shipped poor; not sure if it is the weather but sometimes I cannot use them as starting to spoil.
We left out the chili as we tend to avoid things that are too spicy
We didn't use the sweet chili as it was too spicy for us
"Prefer it sans Salmonella, but thanks for the Diarrhea!"
added bacon - tasted better

like eating tomato sauce - had to add beans
Potatoes were bland and tasted kind of off
"salad was meh, burger was delicious"
Feta cheese does not go great with this. Maybe a hanernari would be better to add a bit of spice.
The tomatoes are consistently mushy. The mushiness stands out when the tomatoes are a salad on their own. Better produce needed all around.
"This tasted just like a green curry that I order in my favourite Thai restaurant in Siesta Key, Green curry paste excellent, Very quick and easy to prepare, I added baby f green peas to the recipe,"
Excellent meal!
"very good, i added some fresh garlic to kick it up a notch"
The salad was the best part!
delicious
Great combination
My favourite so far
Peanuts were not included and the meal lacked a bit of depth.
"Amazing dish. As always, would love a gluten free option."
The sauce is incredible!
Far too spicy - I should only have used 1/4 of the green curry. had to discard as no one could eat it
Broccoli was not fresh.
Fresh tasting and easy to prepare!
Great texture and large portion! Very filling and satisfies the pasta craving. Could be more creamy but good smoky flavour from he mushroom.
Package/meat was leaking. No recipe cards.
"I didn't like the texture of the sauce, I will skip the cornstarch in the future"
Quality of the meat and veggies was excellent but I was hoping for more flavour
Steak was amazing- so tender!
Rice was also inedible...
So much flavour!
Very tasty
The chicken and biscuits were delicious but the coleslaw was not tasty..too wet and very bland
Loved the ricotta beans!
Very tasty and fresh
Add tahini sauce as well and it's even better. More pickled veggies would be good too
The recipe stated to use butter however there was no butter included. I also noticed last week's recipes asked for milk and I had to go and pick up milk. in the past ingredients were included.
the rice was a bit odd but all in all very tasty.
Everyone in my family really liked this!
Delicious and very happy to use my oven vs. stovetop.
Different but delicious!!
Delicious!
pretty good.
"Steak tendre, sauce au ricotta bon contraste avec le poivre et paprika"
The meat was inedible. A disgrace.
Steak was super tender.
Was a little plain
"Great idea, will make again, but the burgers were very bland."
Missed kale in the description!
Would be much better if you had included a description of the ingredients needed to remake the biscuits and chicken seasons from home! I want to be able to replicate these meals on my own!
needed more cabbage and less carrots but was delicious either way
"The chicken lacked flavor. The coleslaw dressing was way too mustard-y. The biscuits were the only part that we liked, but the whole meal was lacking something (maybe a gravy or sauce?)"
potatoes were turning brown
Too much kale and not enough tomato sauce.
tastes amazing and didn't add salt
Spicy! But delicious
These were interesting & good. But any meal that includes a load of white flour in any form will never get 4 stars from me. As a vegetarian my choises always seem limited so for now will accept.
this was delicious
I prefer chicken breast as thighs are often fatty
Cabbage was a bit brownish.
"Too many onions, substitute spinach for kale"
"The fish was very good but the tabbouleh and the sauce were not to our liking - not “bad”, just a preference thing I guess. There was, however, some of the broccoli that was bad and needed to be thrown out"
love the salid
we used a sous vide for the pork and everything tasted amazing
A bit too spicy
"the steak was great, nice crispy potatoes and a big salad!! Loves it!"
watery soggy sauce is created from recipe
"Great flavour. I used a bit too much chile, but that didn't hinder the enjoyment. However, I always find that your ground beef contains a lot of tendony gristle that catches between my teeth (-1 star)"
Very tasty but could use more sauce
"I would pay more to have the option of 4 pitas. Great salad, but our cucumbers were very wilted."
Amazing taste ! Very flavourful
lacked depth of flavour
"Tasted very good, but a bit too spicy."
The beans were soggy like they had gotten frozen. But the steak was good
needs more nan bread
Very bland no flavours
It was good but wasn't great.
Fresh tomato wasn't usable. Canned tomatoes in the winter are better.
"Not enough carrots, and no chicken/vegetable stock was provided, but the focacia buns were a really nice touch, just should have had a flavoured butter on top of it when toasted."
Delicious
"very difficult to make, tortilla shells were so small we couldn't possibly roll them up into a taquito shape.. ended up with quesadillas..."
"Biscuits were good, but found the thighs not nice meat and the coslaw too plain"
kinda boring flavours
okay. Smoke flavor too strong for our family.
love
Great!
This was good but I over cooked the pork because it was still pink in the middle when following your directions
"The chicken portion was small, tasted great but still hungry after"
Very spicy
The pork was a little tough
The burgers needed more cooking time and there was probably too much dressing for the salad.
Didn't like the smokey bbq sauce taste. Didn't seem to go well with an asian dish.
Ingredients not fresh. The avacado came over ripe. I couldn't use it as it was brown inside and had to throw it away. Also the garlic was also dried and shrivled.
Everything was quite tasty. The ricotta vinaigrette didn’t add anything to the meal.
Tasty. Could use more chicken for 4 meals.
The recipe called for fresh pasta and we received dried pasta. Recipe also required butter which other times chefs plate would have included this item but now it is to be supplied by customer.
the fish was a little bland. the guac and sour cream helped alot with flavour/taste
Very tasty and filling. I was serving for 3 tonight so I added extra carrot plus chicken & shrimp. So good :)
"Steak chewy, but tasty."
"Quick, easy & tasty after a busy day at work!"


A favorite. The soup could have been a bit thicker and with fewer onions
Good combo
This is one of my favourite meals I've had through Chefs Plate so far! I'm so glad you brought it back!
"The coating on the chicken was AMAZING. The biscuits were runny and I had to add flour in order for the batter to ""stiffen up"" & 2 tbsps for coating the chicken wasn't enough liquid"
could be spicier
As always the fish taco recipes are delicious. Wasn’t a fan of the slaw though.
everything was good besides our steak. the cut we were given was terrible. would have been great had it not been for that
Burgers very bland.
Really awkward to roll up. Would have been better as simple fish tacos.
We added some cheese to this
Tasty! It needed to be reduced more than the recipe indicated.
"We added some garlic, but overall this was a fantastic dish. Very rich , but delicious. We will definitely be making this again in the future!"
"I would have rated 4 stars, but the directions on the recipe cards were not as organized as they usually are."
"The potatoes were yummy, but the steak was very fatty. The salad was great too."
"Really great flavour, the sauce is delicious! Also a good sized portion. Beware of the chili pepper, VERY spicy."
Unique and delicious. The beans have a smokey flavour.
Far too spicy and a bit too bland. Not enough to fill the stomach
"So delicious, I had seconds!"
tasty but a bit salty and I never added salt
"Biscuits good. Coleslaw too much dijon. Chicken was good, instructions were a little weird - if I followed exactly the chicken didn't come out coated."
A little too spicy. But pleasant!
Loved that this was really easy!

delicious!
"We didn't really enjoy the coleslaw, and there was so much of it! Chicken and biscuits were great"
My mushrooms came in the box crushed so I had to go out and repurchase mushrooms for this recipe
"The topping was great, but the time for the sweet potatoes in the oven was off significantly - ended up burning the nacho portion which is basically half the meal."
Bland
Excellent
"OK, but one of the two cucumbers was mushy and had to be discarded"
"Not enough cabbage, added some Shanghai bok choy"
Another easy and delicious meal
Really really good and easy.
"Was not happy, cucumbers were frozen, feta was emptied in bag"
The potatoes especially were amazing
Recipe needs revising. What do I do with the 1/4 cup reserved pasta cooking water in step 3????


excellent
The steak just melted in our mouths!
"It was alright. Everything was flavourful but it was a little complex and didn’t turn out aesthetically pleasing. It was a lot of work for what it was. But again, it was flavourful."
I wish the serving was a bit bigger
"Loved this! Tasted good, kids ate it, had kale in it!"
very tasty - loved the biscuits and I really like the chef's hints

"Loved the amount of carrot in the bowl. Real addition to nutrition, not just a bit of color, which of course it was as well."
The burgers were very tasty but we had pieces of bone in our ground chicken that really turned us off!
The Zaatar was not very noticeable.
Absolutely loved this one!
Cooking times on chicken were half of what they needed to be. We have found the times to be off quite a bit

The chicken was amazing. I wish you included information to make the coating. I might have preferred plain buttermilk biscuits to the cajun flavour.
potatoes were meh
love it but the cabbage salad was meh
Not my favorite.
"I added beans, was a much needed addition."
The package did not have buttermilk. It only had buttermilk biscuit mix. Receipt therefore could not be made properly
"Needed more flavour and protein, we added a protein on the side (chicken for husband, vegan cutlet for me), but enjoyed the creativity!"
This was DELICIOUS! Please bring this back!
very tasty
Not filling at all
Small meat portion
Dressing on the slaw wasn't my favorite but the rest was great
"The kids loved this dish, but:"


Strips of beef would have been more interesting than ground.
we enjoyed this meal and it was very easy to prepare.
"Very good but a bit too spicy on the dinner course, need to let people know to reduce the hot spice. Lunch salad very nice"
Kids were not sure about the kale but everyone ate it up!
HUGE hit with the kids!!
Too Spivey for our taste
Adding whole wheat buns as a option would be great! We added shredded cabbage slaw to the burger for some crunch and loved the meal.
"Again, way too spicy. We left out the salt and pepper thinking it was us but it's not..."
"Good! Nothing super special about it, but a nicely rounded meal. I would like to see a higher veggie content in a meal though. It was about 1/3 meat, 1/3 starch and 1/3 veg. Would like to see 1/2 veg!"
Great with a glass of Sapporo beer or a semi-dry white wine
tasty and easy
not very good..
Excellent! Especially enjoyed the chutney. Brussels sprouts were done to perfection. And the mashed sweet potatoes were delicious.
It was awful. As we didn't receive any mushrooms.
Steak was good but I had a bone chip in my piece! It hurt to find out the hard way
"Delicious, great flavour not greatest cut of meat"
Needed more sauce
"Good, but too much sweet potato"
"The burger was good but the salads in these kits need to be more than greens, mayo, vinegar, sugar...it’s boring."
Very enjoyable flavour combinations
our bag was missing the Old Bay Seasoning. I'm sure it would have been bettrr if we had it.
I didn't like the bbq sauce in this recipe.
Beef was very lean and tender.. Lots of prep work involved and kept me busy to the last second. Timing is key so broccoli is not overcooked. We loved this plate and would definitely order it again.
Loved the chicken burger. Wish the buns were better quality.
would like if you had some variation of BBQ sauces - different dishes always using the smoky kind are a bit sweet and getting repetitive (but the soy and tahini with this one definitely helped)
Really good flavours... Chicken tenders were kind of gross as they still had the tendons in them
Had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. I ended up throwing out 75% of the meal. Very disappointing.
"There wasn't enough sauce for the amount of noodles, it wasn't very flavorful at all."
"perfect! I will try this with my own ingredients, again!"
Loved this!
Broth wasn't super flavourful--needs something? Stock or more spices? Otherwise good.
"Good and easy to make, but not substantial enough to satisfy anyone with a decent appetite. Basically a soup, which most would eat before a meal."
Excellent
"the taste was good, but the quality of the steak was poor. it was tough and fatty"
Very good!!! The salad was really yummy!
DELICIOUS. cant wait to make this again!
a little bland
absolutely loved this one.
"The steak was terrible. 2 x 2"" pieces surrounded by gristle. Looked like the throw away bits when butchering beef. Potatoes not nice did not like the dressing."
batter didn't crisp up like I expected. kind of bland overall
I didn’t get an avocado!
Could use a little more sauce!
Très bon mais il manquait les pommes de terre dans notre sac
Breading did not work well on the chicken
Meat was tough
Hard to wrap
Not impressed. Steak was fatty/tough and they didn’t pack my red peppers so the salad was boring. Chef’s Plate seems to be having lots of issues since they were bought out :(
Parmesan dressing had a dirt-like texture
I wasn't sure about the sweet potato part but it ended up being fabulous!
Loved this one!
Love the flavour but it would be even better with slices of beef rather then ground.
weird taste
delicious it could use some sausage and some more spice
"The texture of the steak was very weird. Super chewy, especially for a rib eye."
Delicious! Next time I would cook the meat less than eight minutes
"Kind of bland, could have used something more in the wrap, peppers or maybe the cabbage"
Was bland
Way too spicy and not a lot of flavour otherwise
one of favourite meals ever from chefs plate....keep up the good work....
best so far!
too much prep for after work not enough meat
noodles weren't fresh
The tahini sauce and the spice really make this dish tasty! I loved it!
Had no ill effect from the chillies
Loved this one
"I really liked the variation of this meal we had before, but one of the packs of cracked wheat was missing, the carrot was rotten, and we got cilantro instead of parsley."
"I added the full shallot to the filling, and made a salad dressing with fig jam, white balsamic vinegar, and olive oil instead. The calzone filling was very good."
"Had great flavor, did not love the green beans"
tough cut of steak
It was tasty but runnier than anticipated.
Excellent flavour. We have a 3 year old so we didn’t add the heat.
Never received the box...no help from customer service. They blame everyone else but their courier service if your box goes missing. Becareful using chefs plate.
Excellent...very yummy and super easy!
Used all the sauce provided with the noodles and found it still dry and lacking flavour
Best and fav meal ever!
delicious!
Super yummy
"Really good flavors. Really spicy, but I enjoyed that. Smaller portion sizes than I'm accustomed to with chefs plate. It could use a side dish."
Great! Filling to wrap ratio seemed a bit off
"The fish was tasty, but slaw seemed a bit uninspired. Not a lot of flavour from the cabbage. Also, it would have been nice to have some cheese in the taquitos. We ended up adding our own."
"tasty, I didn't care for the mayo in the dressing for the salad. Could have done without it."
bottom of fish still got soggy. but the top was nice =)
Awesome and delicious.
Loved this a little more sour cream pls
too sweet
I like the dish but it lacked flavour.
It didn’t taste good and my box came without one of the ingredients. I was lucky I had at home.
Honestly we could barely cut through the meat it was so tough and chewy
"Super yummy, but portions were very small"
the cabbage slaw was a little bland and the taquitos needed a bit more kick for my taste
The addition of the balsamic vinegar ruined the dish for us. We tossed it out and ordered in some dinner from Skip.
The noodles to sauce/vegetables/cheese ratio was way off. It was basically all noodles. I am not sure if it was because I had ordered the family plan and it was a bigger serving size or what.
Very nice!
this was our favourite this week!
Loved the Apple Chutney!
Food made me sick and I wasn’t notified of a recall until1 WEEK later
A little more cheese would make it more filling
it was a bit watery and not a lot of flavour.
Kinda flavourless unfortunately.
I loved learning how to cook Brussel sprouts!
Pretty basic.
needs an Aoli for the sweet pot
"Great flavor and different textures, but I would cut back on the cracked wheat and add more halloumi instead."
Will try this tomorrow
Good but not great. This week was altogether not great
Beef was chewy
this had great flavour but we didn’t find it very filling as a meal on its own. Perhaps more sweet potato?
too many green peppers retried beans yuck worst meal yet
would have rated higher but your cooking time was WAY off. took an additional 20 to cook. also - wish you would state placement in oven when using more than one pan. what goes on upper rack and what goes on lower rack...
very tasty! but definitely not a 35 minute meal... more like an hour
Delicious!
chicken was flavourful but coleslaw was tasteless until I added my own lime juice
tasted fairly bland
I dont like fish.
east to make and delicious
Potatoes were a bit hard still but good flavours
One of the steaks was extremely fatty. Felt like we cut off at least one persons entire portion of just fat.
There wasn’t enough haloumi.
I really enjoyed. It serves a lot. My kids didn’t love it. But they are picky. You just really have to watch it or it sticks to the pan.
Was very weird. Expecting it to taste similar to chow mein from Chinese food restaurant but the bbq flavor was completely different. Also felt lower quality with ground beef vs. Tiny pieces of beef
took much longer to make than anticipated
It could have been creamier and a few more seasonings
Excellent!
"Chowder was kind of meh, but the ciabatta was amazing."
Great flavour but this really should have been marked as spicy. It was too much for me and I always look for the chili pepper to avoid spicy choices.
Coating didn't really stick to the chicken
jamais reçu
I added one chipotle pepper in adobe to the enchilada sauce. I also blended the sauce in my Vitamix.
This meal would have been a four star rating except ther the bag wasn’t sealed and the snow peas were missing from the recipe
"Super easy and fast to make, tasted great!"
Very easy to make and delicious
"We enjoyed it! could have used a little peanut butter and somethi g to add a little more savoury flavour, or a protein, but it was good!"
we didn’t know that milk was not provided in our box and we normally don’t have milk at home so used water and just was not as good as it could have been
Simple to prepare and very delicious!
The pizza dough was a bit hard to work with but overall the recipe was simple and delicious.
the portion of chicken was quite small. the recipe was very tasty.
The flavour combination was AMAZZZING!!!! Loved everything about this dish - definitely will be craving this one again.
"Meal was delicious, however, the produce was very rotten and did not even use the cucumber or artichoke hearts as they had gone bad."
was really good
very good! please repeat this recipe in future!
"The box was missing greek spices for the chicken, which was in the recipe. Also the portion of tomatoes and cucumbers provided must have been an error. There were 2 mini cucumbers for 4 servings."
Very tiny cucumber rec'd. Unusable
Lots of flavour but not enough toritillas for a family of 4 when the kids are older
Everyone loved it even our pickiest eater.
Would be perfect with some ground pork.
A little too much lime but still good.
Sweet potatoes and kale needed more cooking time. Good pork chops.
only room for 4 stars? This is at least a 5 star meal - Didn't want to stop eating - SO good - SO tasty and SO easy
over powered by the taste of peanut butter
this wa s great kida loved it
I received chicken breasts instead of ground chicken.
The sauce on the noodles was crunchy and not appetizing
Too spicy. Could tame it down by adding less of the green curry paste.
Your tortillas Are always small & dry
Not a fan
kind of bland the sauce was very dry
Followed instructions but noodles where a little gooey and overcooked.
You need lots of oil to fry fish without sticking. Spice mixture was mild - Next time I would save some to add to tomatoes. Red cabbage mix had lots of core and large slices. Had to chop it up finer.
not really enough for 4 adults...could used more chicken
excellent!!
favourite!
once again with a peanut butter base meal. the sauce was nothing like the sauce in the photo and it was a blast of overwhelming Peanut butter flavour that left the meal dealing dry
Too many peppers. Not enough flavour. Sauce too heavy
"Did not realize curry in it, do not like curry"
Simple but tasty
"The slaw portion of this was very lacklustre, taking away from the delicious chicken. Weird pairing."
great peanut sauce
"Tastes good but noodles were all stuck together in a big chunk and peanut sauce was really thick. Tried added in more water to ""loosen"" everything up and it caused the end result to be super pasty."
Instructions weren't clear for how long to roast the vegetables and the halloumi. Halloumi came out overcooked.
Loved everything about this meal. We did trim off the fat from the chicken which was an extra step but the meal was delicious. My picky 6 year old liked it too.
Fresh buns fries were good though I added salt because they were a little plain. Also had to add a little extra to the meatball sub because it was a little plain for me as well.
Easy and tasty
"the seasoning and crust on the fish were great, but the fish inside had the texture of porridge despite looking exactly like the photo from the outside. Very offputting."
"Horrible cut of steak, mostly just gristle"
Amazing!
This was spicy and delicious and we really enjoyed the dinner and lunch the next day!
"The steak was not a great cut with lots of gristle and fat. The salad greens were very bitter, we would have enjoyed a different lettuce more."
Did not enjoy sauce
Not a huge fan
Would have preferred chicken breast and some nann bread
Love the spiciness!
"potatoes were almost rotten, the cucumber was so ripe the inside looked like alovera & the chicken was boring and small portion. all around pathetic"
"This was a fabulous recipe, delicious and filling. I ca n't give it four stars because it didn't have a protein, and therefore wasn't balanced."


The portion could be a bit larger but the taste is great.
Amazing!
wish we’d get a chicken breast instead of thighs. all the chicken recipes seem to use the cheapest chicken meat available.
simple & easy to cook .. taste great
The recipes were great! The ingredients left a hint of disappointment as the spinach wasn’t as fresh as it could have been and needed to be picked through. The carrots were soft. So 2 stars.
way too spicy. tasted only of fire.
Loved it!
The sauce is too sweet. The noodles are not tasty. This is not an authentic Asian dish.
great produce fresh meat very nice recipe
Everything about this was really delicious but the portion size was small.
"A hotter chili sauce would give it a nice kick. Also, the sauce was quite thick, causing the dish to clump together...maybe a little peanut oil would help."
Quick Easy & Tasty!
Way better than expected. Very good. Even the hubby loved it.
the sauce really put this dish over the top
Great meatless meal. Loved the tahini dressing
The veggie/halloumi to cracked wheat ratio was a bit off. Needed more veggies or less cracked wheat.
Bland
N
Not too flavourful and we found noodles hard to eat
The ingredients seemed to be off. I added more tortillas and cheese.
Tasty!
The vegetables needed to cook much longer than the recipe called for but the pesto vinaigrette was a nice touch to the meal.
"Tasted like cheap mexican food, this dish has potential to be better but needs work."
Yummy and so easy
great sides
Can you rate the spiciness of the menus - I do not like a lot of heat - so I would have used less of the spice
needed more veggies
I’m not even like pork but this dish is wonderful!!!
Light & yummy dish
Delicious- but portion of salad and chicken were too small
Carrots were stale and literally floppy
This was really good. Would like it if unsweetened Peanut Butter were used and possibly a little less as well.
Pasta type does not really work well with the dish.
this was delicious but the carrot was rubber and bendable. Luckily I had carrots in the house.
Not quite enough meat for two.
"Yum yum, I wonder if you can veganize it with raw cashews and nutritional yeast"
delicious and easy to make
Would have given it a four but the meat was a bit fatty resulting in smoke pouring out of our oven.
"So tasty! The sauce with the meatballs was very greasy with lots of fat, though. Probably why it tasted so good... :)"
"Could have used more spicy heat, but otherwise the flavors were well balanced."
Bland mush
Amazing!! Delicious!!
I'm really not happy with this recipe. The potatoes were not even half cooked through before starting the recipe and were barely edible after cooking them for much longer than stated. The au gratin sauce for the potatoes simply congealed and left milk and separated cheese over the potatoes.
Needed more Bay seasoning..added our own extra...too much water?
So good! Loved it :)
A really good deal with the extra for lunch
They were great
I added my own chicken and some extra sweet chili thai sauce (it was too peanut buttery) and then it was great. Shrimp would have been good to add too.
the dish it’s self was tasty but the serving size was the smallest we’ve ever seen from Chefs plate. We were both absolutely starving after finishing this meal. not sure what happened to the serving size on this dish but very disappointed.
Love this one every time! Classic! Keep this one in the rotation please!
The worst I ever had. Could not even eat. All in the Garbage ugg
"Too spicy....unfortunately, I did not read the ingredient list which stated that the smoked paprika was hot so I ended up using the whole packet. You should have some symbol identify spicy dishes!"
"Easy, tasty recipe. Enjoyed it."
"Not enough sauce, bland flavour, not enough substance, was hungry later."
Recipe was incorrect.
the salad was my unexpected favorite. definitely making it again!
"a relatively good dish. tasty once finished cooking. this meal definitely took us more like 25 minutes to cook though, not 15"
Really enjoyed this. Filling and flavourful
"Buns were stale , spinach had already gone bad afer being in the fridge from opening only two days."
"Ground beef was a poor choice, I would have greatly preferred chunks or strips of stirfry beef."
kind of bland
"This was a tasty pasta dish with a nice light cream sauce. I would have preferred spinach or even bok choy to kale, but it wasn't bad."
We thought this was the best chef's place recipe so far. Loved it!
a beet and the carrot were rotten and halloumi was tiny
"seasoning was okay and veggies good, just not the best cut of steak. I liked the hangar steak the week before a lot more"
The burger was delicious but the side salas was lacking...
Simple and delicious! Would make again.
"Taste was good but whoever packed the bag made a mistake and there was two types of chicken, and one was extremely fatty."
Missing soy sauce but otherwise good
The Brussel sprouts were terrific. The kids who don't like them normally even ate them.
"Everything nice and fresh, just a little to spicy for me"
Spicy without being flavourful.
It was just ok
Was sent incorrectly.
This was a terrible cut of meat and not worth the cost of the meal - this makes me consider never ordering another meat dish
Taste was good. Portions good. Texture was off (I did rinse the noodles). Noodle to vegetable ratio way off.
Maybe add cheese :) Avacado wasn’t quite ripe even though we left if for last
This was amazing!

"Delicious, but very small portion"
Lovely bok choy...cooked this on Wednesday after sunday delivery and veggies still fresh
Awesome flavour
was a bit oily but otherwise great
Delicious. You used to provide fresh pasta. Prefer over dried
Loved it!
More halloumi cheese needed!
Moist and delicious!!
Obsessed.
"Really yummy, but I think the cheese you use is too heavy on the salt. We all found ourselves uncomfortably thirsty for the rest of the night."
very tasty and tangy!
Steak too much grissel- couldn't eat with my false teeth
the snow peas I received were off
Flavourless.
I added some of the pepper chopped up to the chicken burger.
was not provided with ground chicken as recipe indicated. Was given chicken thigh.
Not enough chicken
Very good. Would have liked a brioche bun for the burgers.
A bit spicy but very tasty
wow! i was surprised this was one of our favourite . I’ve never tried cooking his way before with the spices and such. really enjoyed
very spicy I think these higher spiced recipes should be identified more clearlyin the name of the recioe I would have chosen differently as this was too hot for my taste
The slaw was bland and tasteless. Fish was okay
Salad was good but not great. I found the sesame oil in the salad just a touch much.
Super good. Filling was flavourful. Side salad was very nice.
"We did not like the taste. The noodles was very sticky, may be i didnt cook it well but the recipe did say 'easy'"
First time we've had a bad vegetable - onion could not be used - had gone soft and slimy.
Outstanding!!
Really tasty and easy.
"Le poulet avec les épices a la grec était vraiment vraiment pas bon. J'ai recraché ma boucher. Par contre, les pommes de terre et les legumes étais bon."
"Wish more cheese was included, and more ingredient for the salsa."
"I didn’t enjoy the rapini, maybe broccoli would have been better"
The beans were a bit hard to spread.
Not enough meat in this recipe. Still hungry afterwards
so easy to make and so much flavour!
"portions were a little small, needed more cheese and some heat."
"I think I must have ordered this by mistake, because my husband is allergic to to mushrooms, but I gave it to my parents and they really liked it."
delicious!
"Since there was a lot of spinach, I used half in the vindaloo & served the other half with a lemon vinaigrette. The flavours balanced nicely. Deep, rich flavour to the vindaloo... excellent!"
Had to cook the meat loaf for longer than instructed.
Too much fat on the chicken thighs
not sure what I did wrong but meatballs were bland
Tasted good. The steak was mainly grissel. Couldn’t cut it with a steak knife.
did not like the choice of fish it was soggy and not flaky salad was delicious with fig jam sweet potato fries good
very yummy . excellent tasting fish.
Was really good. Quite enjoyed the meal.
this is th second time we ordered this one and love it!
I expect way more cheese in something called cheesy
It was just OK. Cucumber and tomato were not fresh.
Fish was a little mushy and thin.
Needs tofu
stop using thighs
The cucumber was bad
Really good!
The meat smelled really bad by the time we did this box it wasn't past the best before date but was sour smelling.
"Really liked this dish, very simple"
love the calzones but not a fan of the salad
delicious but took over 45 min to make
"Kale was good, but there were too many sweet potatoes and they were undercooked."
"Chicken was delicious and seasoned, but we had to trim off a ton of excess fat from it so there wasn't much chicken left in the end. Yogurt was also very good."
not enough sauce
"sweet potatoes were not cooked through, too many stalks in the kale. disappointing meal overall. this is the 2nd pork meal I haven’t enjoyed."
Fish spice mix did not come in the pack.
"The potatoes were old, the sandwich was tasty"
chicken was bad - we couldn’t make the recipe :(
Sausages were a little spicy. Delicious for adult but would be nice to know this before ahead since the meal is shared with young children as well.
"Yummy, I think I’d add onions to the veg next time."
Not our favourite. Needed to bake twice as long as recommend too.

Too much vinegar
no pita bread
More sauce would have been nice
meat quality was poor.
"very tasty, love the noodles!"
Really nice combo of flavors.
Way too spicy. We couldn’t even eat it.
Not great... had one portion and threw out rest
Non bad
Provide fresh rosemary for a fresh dip not dried species for a component not being cooked! Disappointed in the quality. Once again- instructions did not provide oven temperature!!
Tasty!!
"portion for 2, could have been enough for 4."
Salad dressing was good. Sometimes they can be waaaay to vinegar-y.
steak was really tough
"Pork was good, potatoes bland."
the sauce is very strong
"burger was amazing, salad just ok"
SO tasty! Ricotta topper was brilliant
Baked goodness
Chicken was way too fatty! I am glad I opened it earlier in the day and spent 30 minutes removing the fat and cutting it apart to do so. Also seasoned t chicken pieces earlier in the day. Delicious
I love any recipe with Old Bay in it. This one is so easy and delicious!
A touch above average because the pork was juicer than I'm had with other boed meal companies.
So simple - would make again.
great flavour and quality ingredients
lots of kale that we should have cooked down a bit more
I love love love these rice bowls. However more of these would be ideal!
Pork cooked up perfect; sweet potatoes were tasty (I added a bit more butter and some cream to make them pop) The apple chutney was a bit tart and not a fan of the mustard with them.
"Unfortunately, the 'pepper steak' cuts of meat were terribly fatty (one worse than the other) and my kids couldn't even chew through most of it. Hoping this was just a 'one off'."
the cheese portion was a bit too small.
Sounded too simple but packed with flavour!!!
"Great flavours, a variety of textures....excellent!"
"Amazing, only complaint is that the tomato got really beaten up. That might not be able to be avoided though."
Tasty and easy to make. The avocado I received was half rotten.
amazing!!!
We cooked this the day after delivery from chefs plate- the avocado was already brown and inedible.
Would have liked more sauce.
Would prefer quinoa (over wheat)
Has a very complete taste pallet that was delicious and easy to make
Filling meal with delicious sides. Pork could have more flavor.
You did not deliver! Very annoying.
You did not deliver! Very annoying
This is one of my favourites so far!!! Absolutely delicious!!
Cooked the steak to a perfect medium rare but found the meat tough. Potatoes and salad were good
It was a decent recipe but I think I'd like to have seen another veggie in here. The carrot that was included was way past its prime and inedible.
The recipe tasted good but lacking. I'd like to have seen another vegetable in here or maybe some tofu. I don't think a a bit of peanuts should be the only protein here. Missing snow peas from order.
"Delicious, a bit more veg would have been nice."
The potatoes did not taste good at all. We had to throw them out
Too spicy and the noodles were not my favourite.
"Burgers were great, salad dressing was a bit bland - could have used more of a kick or a zing"
"Wish it came with more than 5oz of steak per portion, I have 3 adults and 2 kids (who share a portion, wasn't a problem until this meal) to feed and there was not enough steak. It was delicious though"
Decent flavour. Probably needed more salt.
Not filling and flavour was not as fulsome as we had hoped. Disappointing.
Loved this!
"The slaw was really not much, I substituted some chicken for fish in some- and added cheese."
Delish!
Fish could have been crispier and the slaw could have been more dynamic.
The Jerk Chicken itself was really great but I found the slaw to be rather bland - could have used a bit more flavour
Too much spice for the burgers and the bun wasn't the greatest
one of my favorites. perfect
really liked the level of heat.
Steak was really fatty. But we really enjoyed the flavours of the whole meal
Easy and healthy. Good for the whole family.
It was good but not my favourite. Also a little messy to eat.
Easy and simple to prepare. Tasted really good.
Very different
"lots here, we added some mushrooms"
Delicious. Loved the peppers
"This was one of our favourite recipe's from Chef's plate, and we've been using your service for about 6 months!"
Would prefer more vegetables and less noodles.
Meat was super fatty
One of my favourite meals!
"We couldn’t even eat this meal, both of us found it really poor tasting and the smell was very unappealing. I am happy we didn’t like it since the peppers could have been contaminated"
"The veggies and spice rub were nice, and halloumi is always delicious. But we found the cracked wheat to be dry and dull, even with the sauces."
Super delicious and easy to follow instructions.
Really surprised at how well the brussels sprouts came out.
"Very tasty, not really enough food for 2 tall and hungry folks- added a can of mixed beans and voila!"
ricotta almost looks a little curdled after it is heated with the pasta
Wow this was very tasty! Very quick to make as well.
"Very thin for a chowder. I prefer the version with vegetable stock concentrate and celery. Not a lot of ingredients, didnt feel like this was worth the money."
delicious! perfect combo of spices
Tasted good but the guac was a little plain.
A little too hot from the curry and there were too many noodles relative to the other ingredients and for 2 servings.
noodles turned out so mushy lack of instructions on green curry paste made it WAY too spicy for a family dish
I tried baja fish taco before at chefplate. The one with jalapeno was better but this is also good
Decent recipe but portion very small
The sauce for this was not very flavourful and quite watery. Sometimes I wonder if the instructions/ingredients for the family are correct. Just didn’t have a great experience with our meals this wee
cream had a whole in it and leaked out therefore didnt have much sauce
Add more Chili peppers for more spice
"Good, the chicken was nice and tasty . Not much sauce"
"Was a little weird putting the guacamole and sour cream on top vs. Inside, and the spice mix was much hotter than I realized. Too hot"
Amazing
"I am sure it tastes good but the recipe seems to be missing steps, the timing is off, and I need to supply my own butter when i have not needed to before"
I ate two servings and I was full for HOURS
stir fry was so yummy
Love the spice and it tastes like a delicious chili
jamais reçu
"I enjoyed the sweet heat, and the lunch the next day was great. My husband did not like it at all. It was much too spicy for him."
Bland
too spicy
very easy and quick. Tasty too!
More sauce!!
Delicious! loved the spice on the fish!
The flavours were too mild. Needed a bit more kick. Otherwise a nicely balanced dish
The salad dressing had just the right amount of sweetness to compliment the meal. Fish and Chips were very tasty
Great taste. I would bake at a lower temp and for longer rather than high temp for short time. Also not enough food for a family of 4. Needs a salad or side of some sort.
Outstandingly flavorful!!
Easy and fun. Super tastey.
A little dry but very good!
I should not have used all the green paste
Good dish. We were disappointed the pasta wasn’t fresh as CP has done in the past with some of their other pasta dishes.
tomatoes and cucumber were not fresh and worst of all the chicken package was slightly open at the top! Not to mention there was no garlic gloves so i had to go and BUY chicken to finish the meal i already started. not impressed.
Very good
My Sante Fe spice mix was missing from the bag ??
We cut back a bit on the spice for our taste but it was delicious
Disappointed the pasta was not fresh as it historically has been
Love the supper/lunch option
So flavorful
"The grounded turkey is too mushy. I enjoy turkey but if it can retain more texture, it’ll taste better."
Amazing!!
veggies were awesome
disgusting. the fish was not cooked enough and mushy. i had to fry it after to cook it all the way through but it was still mushy. No one would eat it.
i really feel this would have been better if it was baked for more like 30 mins.
"I am so disappointed by this dish. This is my first order from Chefs Plate and first dish I made. My family was massively disappointed. The tortilla shells were dry, it lacked flavour even after I “spiced it up” and added more cheese. No cilantro was to be found in the bag."
Steak was low quality
Delicious!
"Buns were incredibly tiny, junior burger size. Otherwise, flavours were excellent. However, recommend meat should not be pre-frozen."
The cucumber that came with this was rotten and limp. Threw it out as it was past being able to use.
Didn’t eat
"Awful! Potatoes tasted funny, the beef was fatty. I’ve never had that bad of a meal with Chef’s Plate before."
maybe it was the tahini but the flavor was quite heavy
The calorie count was too loud. We had a snack after dinner to fill us up. Not ideal.
Since when do we not get milk with the recipes? To call milk a “pantry item” is ridiculous. We don’t keep milk on hand because it expires and goes to waste. Kind of defeats the purpose of the service.
We couldn’t make the recipe because we were were missing multiple ingredients such as Steak and Garlick pepper seasoning. Maybe the recipe is great but we will never know.
"We added a little more of our own cheese, otherwise was great!"
This was good. Lots of flavour and the peppers had kick without too much burn.
"was delicious, but i wouldn't call it a meatloaf."
I added shrimp and it was really good.
Kids don't like mushrooms
would have been good with a small amount of chicken
This is the first recipe I was disappointed in. The flavor of the marinara just tasted like balsamic and the salad was extremely bitter.
"Added more vegetables, cheese and sour cream, it was really good!"
I'm lucky that I don't eat chili peppers given the recall.
my youngest wasn't a fan of the ginger rice. but everyone else enjoyed it.
not worth the 15min premium
Upgraded hamburger helper
best dish I’ve had so far! bring it back again!!!
Three stars only. The bell pepper was not fresh at all.
"Great recipe, no complaints."
Beef was tough; salad was limp. A disappointment.
"Was pretty good, but old bay seasoning was not included in my order, so just added some of my own seasonings."
Very tasty! The guacamole turned out perfectly and the mix of flavours was amazing!
this was one ok until we blended the whole entire soup.
"Excellent flavours, just not quite filling enough."
Meat was a little fatty and chewy. Salad was delicious.
"It would have been perfect if the cuts of meat were better. Even if you had to charge more, the steaks should be better quality."
AMAZING!
This was good but didnt taste like pad thai at all.

"The cheese was delicious, a bit salty. Loved the tahini sauce. Didn't like the wheat."
"Loved it, fresh and fast, with heat nicely balanced by coleslaw."
So good...loved the mayo and rosemary
This was a very tasty Ragu. The Mushrooms made it superb as did the leeks and kale. The creamy cheddar sauce was delicious.
"The recipe was great! A bit disappointed as the white wine vinegar bag had leaked inside the paper bag of ingreds. The baby field greens weren’t as fresh as usual, picked thru them. 2 stars."
My avacado was black inside way to over ripe ??
So much flavour
I wish there was more halloumi provided. (I debated removing a star for the stingy amount.)
Unbelievably easy but omg those potatoes and carrots - I could eat that every day.
Cheap salad
Bland
Very tasty!!
For this recipe the spiciness is … I love spice but adding all of the curry paste made the recipe VERY HOT/SPICY..no pepper needed. Loved the veggies. I added a TBSP of Peanut Butter
Quick Easy & nice portion size
Very flavourful and filling. The addition of lentils and carrots made for a nice combination of tastes.
more sour cream
Tasty but super spicy!
Meatloaf great flavour. Potatoes and Carrots not a huge fan

I wish the block of halloumi was bigger because it was the best part
"Super easy to make, but we find the pasta easy to tear when serving, since it's pretty big."
very good and easy to make!
"Was good, as shown above"
Great flavor!
If you sold the meatloaf spice mix I would buy 10 packets in a heartbeat!
I wish the yogurt was tzatziki. I wish the chicken was breasts not thighs. I wish the tomatoes weren’t so sweet.
We had to use our own cheese because it wasn't in the package.
The carrots were horrible but the chowder itself turned out ok.
the subzero Toronto weather may have affected the produce. The cucumber in this meal was spoiled as were 3 of the potatoes.
"Not good, the steak was very tough."


Meal did not arrive with others
Only edible meal of week
Better as individual meatballs
Sherry wine missing!!! We had to substitute creatively.
I thought the stir fry was beyond delicious. I did not really like the dressing option for the salad. I would have given this top marks except for the dressing
Perfect
Excellent.
"The salad was alright. the potatoes were alright. The steak, even though well cooked and on the rarer side, was pretty tough and we weren't fans of that."
Not enough sauce to noodle ratio.
Could have used more sauce
"A little heavy on the noodles, but tasty!"
needed more flavour
"The proportion of noodles (too many) to veggies (too few) was off. I didn't like the sauce; it was too thick to mix through the pad thai, and the flavors weren't authentic. Worth a try, but only once."
"Good spice, added cheese. delicious!"
Could have more than 1 cucumber
The pasta in the picture is not the one I received.
The meat was very tasty
Would pass on kale. Use another salad.
Ok go easy on lime
It was good
very very spicy
"My husband loved this dish, I am not a fan of gnocchi- but this was better than others you have had before. Little more marinara would have been perfect."
"This soup was flavourful! I would have less onion (much smaller one) and more carrot perhaps. A whole-grain bread would have been better for me too, as I’m not a white flour kind!"
Flavour combo was great with the salad
So good!! Love it when CP goes spicy
Very tasty and fresh; chorizo sausages are delicious
"Maybe one of the best meals we’ve every hadfrom Chefs Plate, good work!"
"Too much balsamic, otherwise bland pasta."
"Good coating, but fish texture was soft and unappealing. I also think that I found a worm in my fish. Yuck. Side salad was nice."
Needed additional seasoning - was pretty bland as it was.
"This meal was absolutely terrible. The cucumber I received was rotten, the tomatoes had gone bad, the potatoes were spoiled and the chicken had an awful stench. I wasn't able to cook it at all."
"It looked delicious and it was extremely delicious, BUT 1. There was 1 ingredient missing in a package (""No breadcrumbs! Handpacked with care!"" I've actually ordered it because I wanted to try orzo with CRISPY chicken. Can you imagine my disappointment?). 2. Lemon for zesting was slightly ROTTEN (with mold). I would love to have fresh ingredients when I pay such amount of money)... Again both lunch and dinner were delicious and balanced. I hope you'll improve at other aspects as well."
Really enjoyed this
Very tasty and easy to make!
The meal was good but the produce was clearly not fresh (frozen and thawed)
"Not a big fan of chicken thighs, which took away my enjoyment. The flavours were all awesome though!"
Should have had more of a side to it
"Too dry, could have used more cheese layers to really be considered ""cheesy"" Anything."
very bland. ended up throwing it out because no one would eat it
A lot of calories... but we loved the peanut sauce!
Love it!
"The green curry was REALLY hot... it’s lucky I only used about a 32nd of the paste. I also added tofu, because it seemed very thin on the substance."
"Recipe took much longer to make than stated in the recipe, both fornoreparation and baking time. Took me an hour and wished I baked it still longer as it tasted undercooked. Flavour was bland."
"I wasn't sure how much of the pesto and vinegar to use so I used it all. But when all combined it was too much for what veggies I had so I had to ""strain"" them from the coating. Overall, very tasty!"
"This was AMAZING! Everything had excellent flavour & was restaurant quality. My only suggestion - the portion of steak was rather small for 2 people. Could have used a second steak, same size."
"gnocchi sauce had too much vinegar, not enough tomato"
potatoes were crunchy
Really like the pesto sauce with the veggies but the meat was very plain.
these were super tastey!!!
Sooo delicious!
Very yummy and incredibly filling! The sausage was to die for!
what a disappointment to not get the fresh pasta I really hope this is not a cost cutting measure as I won’t be ordering as many meals then
Meal was good but there could have been more chicken.
very tasty
not sure how this was as my box never arrived!
very very basic. not worth the money
Very tasty! Everyone loved it.
Disappointed the pastas lately are no longer fresh
There were not nearly enough cucumbers to tomatoes and very small serving sizes. Chicken took may longer to cook than instructions
Delicious and good portion.
Delicious
It was a bit too thick but tasted great.
Very meh.
The meat was terrible
very flavourful. would order again
Easy to make I just wish it tasted better. 1/2 our artichokes were bad and I had to pull a bunch or rotten spinach out of our bag even though I made it the day the box arrived
fish was extremely undercooked when followed directions provided
Did not taste good at all
Amazing!
loved the flavours! The spinach salad was super fresh and tasty. Great combination!
"I rinsed with warm water but, it turned out mushy and not as tasty as expected."
"Too much balsamic, or it’s the type of balsamic vinegar."
amazing!
We were missing an onion in our recipe box. Meal was ok but kind of bland and boring.
Vegetables were not very fresh.
Bland and basic
Outstanding. One of our favourites so far.
too much peanut butter. should have come with egg or tofu.
So good
We don't drink milk in our household regularly - would appreciate meals including milk like they used to. Really miss the fresh pasta from your previous provider.. Serious down-grade in quality :(
chicken had tons of flavour! salad was refreshing and potatoes were crisp
Soo good.
"missed the crunch of the bean sprouts and the egg tjst is usually in pad thai. also expected a little more heat, it wasnt spicy at all."
It was tasty but needed fresh pasta
needed chicken
might be better with steak or beef loin rather than ground beef
The fish was soggy and bland. There was too much salt and pepper already in the breading
"One star for the salad dressing. The fish was GROSS! That is not the kind to make fish & chips with, very slimy texture. So disappointed especially as the tartar sauce then went to waste."
"boring! We added several things including caramalized onions, mayo for the slaw and added a salad for the side"
"Not enough salad, it would’ve been nice to have more vegetables as part of the meal. I added an avocado to the salad and it helped. It would also have been nice if olives were part of the meal"
Meatloaf well flavoured. Not enough veggies to meet Canada's food guidelines.
Love the dough!
did not like the chicken thighs at all... very fatty.
not sure about this one
Le rapini a souffert du froid à la livraison.
Easy to make and delicious.
Very spicy for kids
Between the mustard on the greens and the balsamic vinegar it gets a bit tart.
Easy and delicious.
not a ton of flavour. expected it to have some heat but I found it to be quite bland.
did not care for this dish nor did my adult daughter
The tacos themselves tasted great. The coleslaw alone was a little bland.
Loved it!
"This was honestly, the least edible thing I have ever encountered. Perhaps just not authentic enough? I can't pin point it, but ended up ordering pizza instead."
would have liked more salad. too much yogurt for
Different shape of pasta than pictured though
the larger pieces of sweet potato were not fully cooked
The pre cooked potatoes and carrots never turn out
Huge portions. Nice quality of pork chops.
Perfect.
Was very good
chicken was great the sides and topping not. could have used few more chicken pieces...
Absolutely delicious...
hot hot hot
Your spicy stuff is WAY TOO SPICY. Luckily I know this so I left off the jerk sauce and just added a few drops to the tacos. Honestly all your spicy stuff is about 100x spicier than I can stand
roll fillings I each tortilla and more sauce would make it better
This was amazing! Oldest son prepared it for the family and it was enjoyed by all of us!
Veggie portion size was small
The salad with this was delicious but we didn’t love the gnocchi sauce
"tasty, but the tomato salad could use a bit more flavour"
Kinda bland but otherwise pretty decent
Good in theory but tasted like bland peanut noodles. Needs fish sauce and other ingredients to be more authentic.
"Easy, quick, and great portions"
It was ok. Had a bit of an odd flavouring. The chicken was not the best quality.
we made these in to little burgers and they were sooooo good!
My favourite this week. The lunch was incredible.
Very good. Nice and light
"Glue-like sauce, not enough flavour, texture. Didn’t look at all like the photo. Disappointing"
tasty
"Not for me. Nothing objectively wrong with this, I just wasn't feeling it."
"Excellent! I added some of my own chicken to this for some protein, and it tasted great."
The spice mix was terrible. Way too strong. As always the dough was delicious so it got 2 stars.
The recipe is great (had it before) but the produce that was sent for it was massively under par. Sending a separate complaint.
Really tasty but noodles were over cooked despite following the directions.
The taste was nice but the rice was mushy even before cooking it. So after heating it the rice seem like it was mash potatoes
that salad tho. not great
"This was a great, quick meal. If anything, I'd substitute mayo for yoghurt"
Excellent
Tasty and easy to prepare.
spice mix was a little too spicy for my preference
The first time I’ve ever had dried pasta (as opposed to fresh) from Chefs Plate ever. Prefer the fresh 100%. Also the sauce on this dish was just too watery even though we tried to let it thicken.
SO GOOD. Would've preferred no alcohol used in recipes though.
Found it dry not enough sauce
Loved the peppers.
"Heavy on starch, light on vegetables."
Sweet potato mash not so great. Better to have roasted them or switch the mashed sweet potato for regular mashed potatoes
"Wasn’t super flavourful and not enough sauce, noodles were quite naked"
Tastey
Spices for fish were great; cabbage slaw was boring
Really enjoyed this. Flavourful and easy.
Would have been tastier with more sauce.
Cabbage slaw wasn’t the best but the taquitos were great
The BBQ sauce was a bit weird
"Very tasty. Recipe had an error on it, thankfully I figured it out!"
Nobody in my house enjoyed this recipe. I will not order again. Would like to see edamame as an ingredient in other dishes.
The steak was so incredibly chewy we couldn’t even eat it. Ended up throwing it out ??
Been receiving Chef’s Plate twice a week since Sept 2017 and this is by far our favourite recipe - have ordered it twice!
"Boneless pork was very dry - for baking, need pork with marbling. Sprouts, yams, & apple chutney were excellent!"
"Very flavourful. Added garlic (because, why wasn't it there in the first place!),"
Excellent
Ok
we buttered the buns before toasting
I did not drain the beef as the recipe was so step by step I wanted to follow it exactly. My fault but comprimzed the taste.
A little to spicy for me but otherwise Excellent
Average
Large Spinach leaves plus the dressing weren't a good fit for this burger.
Steak had too much gristle.
Not the most tasty recipe
Very good. A bit spicy but we liked the spice. It maybe too strong for others.
We enjoyed this recipe very much.
Very good.
If I could give 10 stars I would. I would just add a little bit more Halloumi
outstanding
This recipe was one of the best things I have ever eaten
It was just okay. would have been nicer served over rice
Not enough meat for 2 people. Steak tough
I wish it wasn’t ground beef. Steak would have have beef much yummier in it.
Excellent
seasoning wasn’t great
Steak was chewy and fatty. Potatoes were soggy.
"Decent, but nothing special."
This was really good and easy.
You CANNOT cook the potatoes for 10-14 min. They were still raw and had to be thrown out. 10 oz of steak is not enough for 2 adults. This was a horrible 1st experience.
The recipe itself is fine but I thought I was supposed to get fresh pasta! Disappointed
this was an auto selection that we did not want. dont like ground beef in stir frys. should send a reminder email on Thursday before you are locked into meals
Too much cabbage salad
Meat was tough and had quite a bit of grizzle
Not enough flavour
Soooo flavourful!!!
Arugula was rotten - could not make salad.
This is something we will make again and again on our own. Very versatile.
Kale was a bit meh. Instructions should of had sweet potatoes cook for longer.
this was our favourite of the week. even our son ate 2 bowls!
loved this dish! flavour was perfect
This was an excellent recipe and very flavorful!
items missing from package. average tasting and small portions
Loves the dressing on the salad. Felt the two main flavours didn’t fit together. I liked the gnocchi separate from the salad.
Dissapointing
A bit salty
Didnt have depth of flavour we are used to. Would have been better with some protein
Strong balsamic taste but good!
The spice was a little over powering in the calzone. The salad was a little boring
"fish wasn’t cooked in the time they listed, had good flavour though"
Yummy and easy to make
MOULDED green pepper and mushy tomato!!! I will never be ordering again
This was yummy
Added a little ground beef
Ok- fish breading was not great
Excellent!
Very good
Delicious!
"the Cilantro was not fresh, it began to go mouldy"
"The vegetables were fantastic. Meat loaf was good too, but could have been better with onion or something."
Easy to prepare but not very tasty and easy to over cook based on recipe times
Yummy and easy to make
This one was very good. Easy to prepare.
Potatoes were a bit plain.
Tomato was smushed during delivery. Had to buy a new one.
Delicious!
"This was a miss. For some reason, despite all the sauces, it turned out flavourless. The kids would not eat it."
"Sauce was not creamy, little taste or flavor."
It was good but bland. Needed more spices
Would have been nice if the milk came with it.
We didn’t receive the artichokes in the meal kit.
This recipe was not very good. There was way too much peanut butter which was very overpowering and it was all we could taste.
just perfect
Delicious!!!! Will create for sure again!
The sauce was not great on the pasta. There was too much balsamic vinegar and not enough marinara sauce. The salad had way too much Parmesan and we couldn’t eat it.
"needs a sauce to go along with it , little too dry"
portion too small
Amazing!! Too many onions
Heavy!!
"Too much peanut butter, other flavours were lost. Could use eggs, bean sprouts, and green onions for a more Pad Thai feel"
Delicious
Not quite enough food
Great
Ok
Oven temperature (450) was a little too high we turned down to 425 after a few minutes and this worked great
Good and easy to make.
Loved this. Good flavours and very quick.
not enough meat for 2 people. i had 3 small bites of the beef so my boyfriend (who doesn't javr a huge appetite) could have an actual portion.
Good technique but needed more flavour.
Great.

This was soooo good and easy to make. So different than anything I would typically make for myself. Will try to make this on my own
I haven’t eaten this one yet but I did cook it and put in the freezer so will b nice to have on hand for when I’m in a pinch
Lack of flavour builers and amount of sauce.
MUCH TOO SPICY FOR MY FAMILY
MUCH TOO SPICY FOR MY FAMILY NO ONE ATE IT
Too small but good
Delicious!
This one is my favourite all time recipe
I really enjoyed the apple chutney that accompanied the pork
Kids lived it. Even the one who doesn't like sweet potato
Loved this for lunch! Such a good idea
really yummy burgers! fresh buns and great flavour. we ended up making some oven fries to go with
A lot of fat on the cut of steak. Flavours were good though.
I've already got the ingredients and made the recipe again! Especially loved the apple chutney.
Yuk
Superb!
I added coconut milk to the curry to make it way better !
Delicious! Wonderful flavours
Both the supper and the lunch were delicious. Will definitely save this recipe to make again
"Tasted great, but if a recipe calls for butter, it should be included"
The chutney was too acidic for my taste and my son
Delicious and my child's favorite meal of the week.
Was not really enough steak for 2 people.
This was so yummy. I will surely be making this again.
More Halloumi!
Simpler meal. But very good.
I felt like there could have been more carrots and sweet potato
Enjoyed this. Seasoning was decent.
I wish I could give this negative stars. It was so gross. Ended up in the trash and we had peanut butter and jam sandwiches.
usually 15min meals are not overly flavourful but this was great
"needed more seasoning, quite bland"
One of the best burgers I’ve had. The side was below mediocre. I think a coleslaw or potato salad would have worked better. The bun also could have been a bit harder as the meat was so soft.
"There was no broccoli in this package, and the peas were musty with some rot, making them unusable."
Terrible! Meat laced with gristle. Couldn’t eat it. I contacted you to advise. Rec’d credit. Thank you.
Enjoyed...chicken would have been a better meat choice
"this was SO spicy without warning, there was also no ingredient list for what was in the green curry paste. I am allergic to ginger and threw away the pack of ginger but I had a reaction to this after only one bite. so either there was ginger in it or I’ve discovered a new food allergy. This was not pleasant."
pork and brussels were great. sweet potato mash was a wet consistency and not much flavor.
You could use a stick blender in the pot instead of removing some of the sweet potato and mashing it
Spoiled by Hungarian paprika and used to a smokier flavour but still really good.
"The finished meal was delicious. However, the cauliflower, carrot, beet and parsley I received were not as fresh as I would have liked."
found bone shards in chicken while eating the burger
prep very easy and quick
should not use ground beef and flavour not as good as previous two meals
"Spinach salad was boring. A bag of plain greens is not a salad. Do more roasted or sautéed veggies, especially in the winter."
tartar sauce made this overall med recipe for the fish category.
Kinda missed a healthy veggie
"The sweet potatoes were good BUT the basa fish was terrible...it is not a nice flaky fish, very spongy."
Fast & easy and delicious..
Very good..fast & easy
"Meatloaf was good, could not use carrots. They were very old, soft. Vegetables sub par"
"Fish was good, could not use one sweet potatoe, it was full of black holes. Other 2 was able to salvage but had black holes as well, vegratbles sub par."
the balsamic vinegar leaked in the bag. The plastic bag it was in was not properly sealed.
Carrots were soft and bad. Had to replace.
"The cucumber was frozen, so a bit mushy after thawing. But understandable in the weather"
Sausage wasn’t great
Very good
Did not like sauce
"We thought it was going to be Chef's plates fresh pasta noodles but was dried noodles instead. Disappointing. Otherwise, it was a functional meal."
Loved this loved the flavor wish the proportions were bigger for them didn't seem like enough chicken
Noodles were different than shown
It was flavorful and moist...very good
Very good
"Quality of the frozen fish was very disappointing: mealy texture, bland taste."
"What happened to the fresh pasta? Also this week we missed our milk and butter. If this is the new norm for the price reduction, it isn’t worth it."
"Loved the sauce! Got 3 generous portions out of this meal, so had it for lunch the next day. Woot woot!"
Chicken was a bit fatty
"I liked these a lot, however, I am not a fan of green peppers. Also easy to make."
Not enough chicken for 2 people
Caught by surprise that milk no longer comes with the meal.
Fish did not really have any flavour
Loved the gravy tomato sauce
"way too few vegetables included, but very tasty."
Chicken thighs were really fatty
Delicious
"Tasty, but protein portion was too small relative to all the other ingredients (not enough chicken to even conservatively fill each taco)."
bring this back! it was so good
The pork was dry and sauce didn't have any flavour except salty. Sweet potato was under done despite cooking longer than called for. Worst recipe of all the kits I've ordered.
Not super flavorful
The salad dressing was too bitter - would have been better with a more simple dressing in my opinion. wasn't crazy about mustard - otherwise good!
"the cook time on the chicken was not long enough, otherwise the flavors were very tasty"
"The seasoning was perfect, the cook times took longer than the recipe stated."
Good sauce but I think it would’ve been better using a heavy cream instead of milk
Very tasty. The vinaigrette was a tiny bit too vinegar-y.
Loved this one
Easy and tasty recipe. The ratio between sauce and pasta was way off for 2 servings.
"Filling and satisfying, loved how the flavors complimented each other. really enjoyed it"
"This was indeed a favorite, it was a 2 napkin meal, the level of heat in this was amazing and love the simplicity"
Sauce was very thick
even my vegetarian friend was tempted !
the coleslaw needed more flavour
"Chefs plate is a great service, but I have to say that in general the fish dishes they offer are mediocre. Typically it is basa fish which is pretty bland and slimey, no matter how it is cooked."
Really enjoyed this meal
The meal was far too acidic. There was too much balsalmic vinegar. A dressing should have been made instead if adding mustard and vinegar directly to the leaves. The dressing needed to be balanced.
I really enjoyed the fish!
this would normally come with fresh pasta but this was dryed pasta not near as good amd not worth the money at all
Delicious!
really tasty and easy to make. I've never made Spanakopita. Love the spinach side salad.
Aside from the mishap of my box and this bag (which I was reimbursed for) this recipe was really delicious. I look forward to making it again in the future!
Ok but nothing special.
tomatoes and cucumbers had frost bite but this was our favourite meal of the week
"This was excellent except for my very disappointing cucumber: the smallest I've ever seen, and 1/3 of it was soft and mushy so had to be discarded."
So good!!! Just wish we ordered double portions!
so easy to make!
I couldn’t use the rapini because it froze and it was Not edible. Threw it out.
great flavour but needs an additional side dish Adding cheese or adbocado also enhances the tacos
It was good except the green sauce.. unfor. no one in the family liked it.
My kit was missing the souvlaki seasoning.
good flavour
Didn't love this recipe. It seemed like there were way too many tortillas and not enough cheese/sauce.
"With the bread of the sub, some other veggies would have been better."
these veggies were so yummy with the pesto sauce on it.
serving size for 2 seniors was a bit too large
Chicken was poor quality - a lot of fat! Disappointing!!
Not all the spinach was usable. Hard to store spinach for very long. Great taste though.
"Very yummy, but it was missing the spice ingredients package and I had to improvise from my cupboard :("
Delish!
"Was amazing, very tasty."
this might be the season: the tomatoes and cucumbers were a little underwhelming by Saturday
very average
Would rather full chicken breasts sent vs thighs
Needs onions
"The ""salad"" was too simple but everything else was great."
delicious! would order them again!
"We found the spanokopita spice that came with the kit was quite spicy, and too spicy on the salad for our liking."
"pork chops were tough, sweet potatoes were mushy, not a very hood meal"
Overall very good my cucumber was soft and in edible but other wise good!
Very good
Stay away from broussel sprouts
pretty good but didn’t notice I needed to provide my own milk until it was too late
"cucumber provided was very small, salad did not turn out as well as it could have."
"Next time, I would use less garlic in the kale."
"Very nice, but the fish was still very very moist/wet so there wasn't a real crunch"
pretty bland
The recipe was yummy! I did have to pick through the greens because they’d started to spoil though
There wasn't enough cheese or vegetables. I'd prefer flour tortillas.
Didn't love the flavour of the sausage and Italian seasoning spice
"Would have preferred chicken breasts instead of thighs, but overall still very good!"
Very good
So creamy and delicious!
"Was good, we added shrimp to it. It was less spicy then my son expected based on the recipes we get from Chef Plate so he was very happy."
"Its was okay, too much balsamic in the dressing over powered the taste"
"Only criticism is the tomatoes were well past their good date - they were very mushy - otherwise, very good taste."
Should come with more than one carrot
Bland
"Salad was great, breading did not work well on the chicken"
"Beans and veggies were good, tortillas left something to be desired"
coleslaw was brown and slimy.
could use some sort of spice in the bean sauce
Delish and super easy to make. The yogurt sauce was amazing on the chicken and potatoes!

The cucumber we got was rotten. Thank goodness we had a spare
Not our favourite.
Not enough salsa.
Why does every spice mix include chilis or other peppers? Could they be a separate package?
delicious
The meatloaf seemed a bit bland and was a bit burnt on the bottom so crumbled when I tried to slice it. That could’ve been my fault though. Wasn’t my favorite.
Spicey and no flavor just tasted like pepper chicken.
Very yummy. Would order again!
"The food was good, however the quality of meat was terrible. I had to cut the fat off which was 3/4 of what was there. Very disappointing."
This is the worst recipe I've ever ordered. Had to throw it all out
Delicious on a cold night after the gym
Tasted amazing
Tasted and smelled amazing
This was good. I added feta and red onion to the salad
Way too much peanut butter in recipe
"Delicious, but dough was challenging to work with. Did not stick together and generally made a big mess trying to assemble calzones."
awesome !
these were good but lacking spice.
Portions were quite small
Veggies were slimy. I used my own. Spices were good as usual
"We didn’t really like this one either, we won’t be getting any more dishes from Chefsplate."
"Good, would order again"
Pasta was kind of doughy. Salad was good
"Recipe is excellent, but photo is inaccurate, 'castellane' not orecchiette' shown. Misleading. More help on parts of the rapini to use. Cellophane packages difficult to open, cheapens the experience."
"Tasty, large portion, followed directions but the rice noodles were overcooked"
Noodles weren’t fresh
The meatloaf took several minutes longer to cook than stated in the recipe. Might be easier to make it into 4 mini loaves.
Noodles weren’t fresh
Loved it!
We loved this! Would order it in a restaurant for sure.
The peanut butter was very overwhelming.
Great flavour! Quick & delicious!
the refried beans were not a hit with our family
Vraiment délicieux!
It was delicious but a tad spicer than I would have liked.
Loved it!
Second time I have had this meal and it is one of the best you have every put out. Great mix of textures and flavours. Halloumi is completely satisfying.
Made the chowder today and the chibatta buns were moldy.
One of my all time favourites and easy to make
Very plain
One of the best
"Tasted great, preparation a little difficult"
good but no thai pepper in the bag!
One of the best meals we have ever received! I would give it 10 stars
Very good. However would have been just as goo to cook the rice from scratch
"Bien mais le sachet de Old bay etait vide, dommage."
very good !!!!
Did not come with ground chicken as advertised. Came with pieces of chicken breast that could in no way be used for a chicken burger
"Slaw ws boring so we tweaked it with some mayo, lemon juice, salt, pepper and smoked paprika"
Allergy to peanuts
The burger was phenomenal. I really enjoyed it. But the salad was underwhelming.
I was really surprised how good this one was. I really enjoyed it.
"I was really surprised how much I disliked this dish. Steak and potatoes are usually an instant win. But the pre-cooked potatoes were weird. The meat was alright, weird spices. The salad was abysmal."
The dish in general was very good. The sauces weren't that great. Needs more flavor.
Very good. New flavour option that we haven't really seen previously.
wasnt that great.
Too many noodles for us!
"Th concept is great but the dry pasta is disappointing! I got excited when I read the instructions and it said fresh pasta, however this was not the case when I looked in the bag."
"Very bland, needed spice"
"big fail the only good thing was the potatoes and dip. using dried Parmesan made the salad gritty, the steak was very tough and fatty"
Very flavorful and hearty. Prefect for cold winter evenings.
Too spicy could hardly eat our meal.
"I would recommend having a suggested portion of spice to use if we want it to be not too spicy for the kids, yet not too weak for the adults. We loved it though!"
A bit sweet...
It was really really spicy in stirfry form. The dressing seemed to tone it down in the salad
Garlic was missing. Made due without.
"One of my top 5 favs, and I've been using Chefs Plate for about a year now."
"This was very good flavour and prep wise but portions were small, especially the bun. The spinach did not preserve well vacuum packed. I prefer printed recipe cards in the box."
great flavor great size portion
would have given a full star rating but the halloumi was not included in my package
not a lot of flavour
"good, but our steak was not a great cut; meat was chewy"
"This was delicious and easy to make - it tasted just as good reheated the next day! Most of our produce was in rough shape though, and we made this meal the day we received the box."
"Excellent, was my favourite for the week"
Sauce was kind of weird
Too spicy for the kids!
Steak was so tough it was unchewable!
Delicious! The apple chutney was perfect.
We enjoyed but kids did not. Slightly time consuming but great flavors.
The sauce/seasoning was not that great.
The mushrooms were not sent the bag and the wrong menu card was sent. Used my own chopped beef as a substitute. It was pretty good so thanks for improving my improv cooking skills
Was a little plain and lacked flavor
"Excellent, totally enjoyed this one and would like to see it offered again."
"Too much sauce and too spicy, even using a small portion of the chili garlic sauce."
Il manquait de sauce et d'autres pâtes plus petites auraient été plus adaptées :)
pasta was not fresh (dried pasta) and the large amount of kale seemed to overpower the pasta.
Not good value for the money.
"Good flavour, needed more hallumi"
Very bland. I added some chipotle sauce and it was much better
Delicious and the kids loved it too!
The wontons were a little boring and could have used some oil and seasonings
"Biscuits were great, chicken was good but salty."
We lived the spicy black beans
Fish was tasty but tabbouleh was not to our liking


"Potatoes were still very hard, seems like they weren’t cooked enough before and broiling them with sauce didn’t help. Pork chops were tasty"
only used 1/2 the kale
I would have liked more sauce
Very tasty but the texture wasn't like fried chicken at all
"I didn't love the potatoes, but everything else was great!"
"This was okay, it wasn't great for flavor. The cabbage mix was way too spicy for my son, the onion that came with it was moldy and the carrot was huge making it disproportionate."
"loved the biscuits, the coleslaw could have been tastier or just a different veg option all together"
so good. would order so many times! please bring back!
pre-potatoes were undercooked/raw & salad dressing was bland and tasteless. Porkchops were good
"husband loved the coleslaw , we didn't care for the biscuits"
So tasty - it was almost too much food but we managed :)
"Pork chop was great, potatoes ok could have used a longer cook and not just a broil, salad was terrible, way to much acid and nothing to balance it"
Good taste. One problem was it said it was to be breasts and it was thighs.
"Dijon was a bit overpowering, Recipe should direct it to be added to taste. It was a nice combination though."
love!
The chicken we received was rotten
Always love the fiesta style meals - great flavours.
I would add some extra moisture to the quinoa somehow next time.
"Good, but our biscuits did not turn out, the batter was too liquidy!"
Very good
3-stars just because our delivery was missing hummus and it's a staple in middle eastern cuisine. Otherwise it was great.
Deelish!
Je n'ai jamais reçu mon panier ??
Love it!


The dressing was a bit too strong (maybe a bit less garlic).
i did not know ahead of time that i would need to supply my own milk. unfortunately this meant i had to use vanilla almond milk
Delicious
The beef strips were very tough and rare cooking to the directions of the recipe
It was tasty.
it was yummy but didn’t seem worth the cost
"Unfortunately, the broccoli was rotten, but we ate the fish, it was ok."
Definitely took longer than 15 minutes but delicious!
"Very tasty, simple and interesting. The carrot was enormous."
Chicken really good. Biscuits too savoury and too much Dijon in the coleslaw.
It was a promising recipient but the cut of meat was poor - it didn’t seem to have been trimmed properly-way too much fat and connective tissue still attached. Also please try balsamic vinegar on sala
So good!!!
Nice combination of smokiness and heat. A good and hearty one-plate meal!
could use more spices
I’ve have never seen my husband so happy at the end of a meal! He LOVED this. it was so simple for me to make and sooo good!
Very spicy but very good!
Easy to prepare and a nice fresh taste.
"Easy to make, super delicious."
The fish was a weird texture. Might be good with a different type of fish.
Better than expected. Kids loved it.
a little spicy
My favorite so far!!
Loved this and so did the kids!!
very gummy steak other than that the actual recipe was good
yummy
Very tasty! Definitely satisfied my burger craving.
We loved this one!
The apple chutney is delicious - this is a meal we’ll definitely make again!
very good
"A little hard to eat, but delicious!"
awesome! taste is superb!
A veggie for the greens would have been nice.other than that it was great with tons of flavou.
Didnt realize we needed to have our own milk - assumed it was included in the bag as in the past. Felt the recipe should have dredged the chicken in the buttermilk and then coating. Weird coleslaw dre
"Very tasty , new idea for potatoes I will try again and the ricotta complemented the steak so well I was impressed, would have liked more meat though and it took longer than expected."
"Very yummy, impressed it was vegan had lots of spinach though for it and partner wasnt a fan of the added shallots but that's more personal preferance. Definitely recommend."
"The burgers had great flavour, but we weren’t huge fans of the texture. Would’ve been great with a crunch."
there should be no msg in your food there was in the breading
43748
"Food was great. The packaging wasn't great, the plum sauce leaked so we didn't have much sauce with it."
"the quality of the chicken wasn't very good, it was very faty. Turned out pretty slimey."
"Unique. I like that it’s healthier then most Mac and cheese dishes; however, more cheese is preferred."
Not good as leftovers
Best recipe so far!
"Fish was really soggy, tomatoes were over ripe. Just wasn’t a nice dish."
guacamole was good. fish was good. tomatoes made the taquitos a bit soggy. sad there was no cheese.
There are few things around that have tasted this bad. Really not impressed with the quality of produce.
Coleslaw sauce was not good
Not the greatest sauce
Very easy to make and very tasty.
Good Flavours
Needed nut for a crunch
"All your recipes and food are tops , My stomach is at peace with your service."
very tasty
Would definitely make this again. Full of flavor and perfect for my lactose intolerant husband.
"wicked dish, absolutely delish"
Delicious idea w the rosemary mayo
didn’t like thigh meat breading was a sloppy mess when I followed instructions biscuits turned out flat like pancakes
1/2 inch slices made for soggy potatoes. Nacho speaks of crisp.
"Can’t go wrong with steak and potatoes, very yummy although kids said steak seasoning tasted like soap, and unfortunately green beans were completely rotten and mush when arrived."
Should be fresh pasta
My order never showed up
This was very tasty but we were again disappointed in the freshness of the vegetables.
"Addressed the issue about all meat coming frozen, worked around it to be able to cook dinner on Monday. Thought it tasted delicious, however too spicy for my 8 year old daughter."
this was a delicious flavor party in my mouth
so good such a nice alternative to corn chips
"My husband thought this was ok- but the kale sucked up all the tomato sauce and I only used about half of it. I didn't like the crunchy of the kale with the soft of the noodles, personal preference."
Coleslaw never turns out too great in our Chef's plate kits. I prefer salads.
Never got the opportunity to make it because my box was not delivered or stolen.
Never got the opportunity to make it because my box was not delivered or stolen.
AMAZING
"There wasn't much flavour to this one, very bland."
Coconut milk can was dented.
steak was a little grizzly
Nothing too exciting
The meal kit made my entire fridge reek until I made up the dish. Once I made up the dish it did not taste at all good.
Every time we get this lettuce mix it is bad if we don't use it on the first day.
"Sooooo bland. I had to re season, just so I felt like I wasn’t eating sand pasta."
I love the idea of the leftovers that are a different meal. awesome. Carrot fries?!?!!? loved them
"I did not eat the potatoes as they were undercooked and I did not like the texture, look or taste."
Great!
"Just not enough flavour, meat was tough and full of grizzle."
Loved the cut of meat! Full of flavour.
needs more salsa and more fresh tomatoes
the chicken had gone bad
"Biscuits weren't very good, chicken was bland."
"Pork and salad were create, potatoes were not good. They were very underdone despite following the directions."
this was one of my favorites ever
Sauce was a little spicy but it was good!
Perfect!
"Pork was good but the potatoes were very hard, not very edible"
too saucy... needs ginger!
the coleslaw didnt have the swert tangy flavour me and my damily are use to. hovwever thr chicken coatinf was excellent. the biscuits were good.
Perfection!
"Flavour was good, easy to make but it was a little dry."


????
"I added extra onion, some roasted garlic and extra soy and it is very tasty! I will make this again and I love the crisp wontons!"
Would have loved more broccoli included
"too much mustard, the buttermilk biscuits did not rise"
i found the burgers to be a good size with 5 so incould use an extra bun. very tasty.
Loved the sauce!
Very spicy!
"tomatoes were over ripe, cooking time was longer (even in a hot oven) to ensure it was cooked"
Sauce was very very sour.
kinda bland would have preferred the basmati rice. The meat was so tough and gristlely it took away from the entire dish.
Gah! amazing.
Flavourless and soggy
"Instructions referenced 'shallots', red onions were in the kit!"
"disgusting, didn’t even eat it"
Very greasy! The grease that pooled on the tray from the beef almost started a fire in my oven!!
I wish your calzones were on the menu more. Always a favourite!
Delicious
very tasty but we were both quite hungry after and the cucumber that came with it was mushy
delicious & so easy
I liked it but my husband ans son weren't impressed.
Excellent!
"Sweet potatoes needed way longer than a few minutes to cook properly, I think they weren't parboiled enough. The rest was great."
We liked the salad very much and the sweet potato fries as well. The fish however was bland.
meh

Nice recipe but would have preferred the meal to have more vegetables. A lot of noodles are provided but I feel the vegetables could be increased.
"Not a fan of the large chunks of roasted garlic. One piece of pork had a lot of fat I cut off, leaving a rather small piece of meat."
Everythibg was flavourful but the chicken portions were small. The produce also didn’t stay fresh. The cucumber was watery and could not be used despite using it the day after it was received.
sauce was good but disappointed to have pre-packaged gnocchi
It was okay. I felt it could of been a little creamier and a bit more cheese.
I really liked this one. Salad was fresh and chicken was great.
"It was ok, but a little bland."
this was good we added some ground beef for the kids and it turned out great..
"Adding feta to salad made it delicious, chicken was really good!"
Delicious but heavy cream instead of milk would have put it over the top.
Needs more veg and less noodles
"Too many tortilla shells, bland,"
I usually really enjoy the fish recipes but this week the fish was very mushy and spelled bad I think it was rotten fish or something
Very good. Shocked to find out that Chefs Plate is no longer providing milk. Luckily I had enough for the recipe in the fridge as I typically dont drink a lot of milk/have it on hand.
The cucumber had gone bad and for some reason it came with tree chicken thighs. And there’s no WAY there were enough potatoes for two people. Had to use stuff from the fridge to make it suitable.
I enjoyed this one it was easy and the spices were yummy
thought this lacked a bit of flavour how ever my daughter made it so maybe she missed something LOL
We found the prepackaged sweet potatoes a bit mushy .
Would love to give it no stars.
A little bitter
"Did not like salad dressing, calzone were great"
"Not related to this, but can you keep breadcrumbs separate from the spice instead of incorporating into ""spice mix."" I am gluten free and will substitute GF bread crumbs if spice is separate. Thanks"
It might have been better with different shells (they were a bit tough and strong tasting) and more cheese.
Lots of flavour! Loved it!
Enjoyed the fish and the dressing for the salad was very nice
Salad had spoiled before we had time to eat it.
the yam fries turned out a bit soggy
enjoyed!
Pretty good. Could have used some egg mixed in and some green onion for garnish.
We don't like Kale so i left it out but the rest of the meal was suberb! Again the meat wasn't cooked in the time frame listed in the recipe but I adjusted accordingly.
I found it tasted really strongly of vinger. Wasnt my favourite.
So good! Salad was a little bland though.
"Bland, too runny"
We didn't get the Boscaiola mix with the recipe. Otherwise tasty but no veggies.
Pork chops & kale were okay. Sweet potatoes were crunchy and bland. Definitely not something we would order again.
"gnocchi was good, should not pour balsamic vinegar in your pan when at medium-high heat though, it splatters all over the kitchen, salad was okay"
"not enough beans, the sauce was kind of gross as well. there were also no baking temperatures in the instructions"
too many noodles
"These were good, could use a bit more flavour and maybe something to break up the flavour on the side like some spring rolls or something"
Loved it! My super picky 7 year old couldn't get enough.
To small of portion
Kale very hard to chew. Flavours good though
Really tasty. I made extra sauce as sometimes there’s not enough. I’ll use this sauce on chicken as well!
"The meal was great, but I found we were still hungry afterwards."
"Meal was great, portion was good! Only down side was had to be doing something the whole time to cook it."
Excellent meal - teenage boys loved them
"This would have been elevated if it had chicken. Still, quite yummy."
Lacked in flavour and ingredients weren't terribly fresh.
A little too much peanut butter flavour.
Box choy didn't come in the bag. Tasted okay otherwise
"favourite, favourite recipe hands down"
Sweet potatoes weren't quite cooked enough for warming up to be sufficient. My husband isn't a fan of kale or sweet potatoes but was willing to give it a try. The pork was good though.
the fish was mushy in the batter - not really any taste
Awesome!
"Simple to make, yet very tasty!"
was super yummy
enjoyed making something with dough. came out beautifully. fun to try & delicious to eat.
So delicious! We will definitely make again!
"Tasted great, was quick and easy to make."
"Very tasty recipe ,as usual. However , 2 carrots were included in the bag that I could have tied a not with them. Trimmed 2 inches off for rot, 6 months old?Not your Mission Statement."
"Absolutely Excellent - Great Flavour, Easy to prepare, Healthy. Would definitely order this again!"
Cook time on noodles was too long - came out gluey
Soggy fish was uninspired.
"I added more lime, a pinch of sugar and fresh cilantro to the coleslaw. The chicken was great."
I wasn't a big fan of the greens in the pasta. The sauce was super tasty though.
"Difficult to put layers together, but tasty!"
chicken thighs not my fav
weirdly sweet but still tasty
I found the beans very dry after cooking and mashing them - it made them hard to spread on the tortillas. Other than that - very tasty!
"Good, but would have been better had the pasta been fresh and had there been more veggies"
It was good but It had oo much peanut butter taste for my liking in a pad Thai
Delicous but had to add a salad
Our family really didn't care for this one.
Enjoyed vegetables. Not much taste to meatloaf
This was awful. I was so disappointed because I love gnocchi!
Real’y Liked the fig jam in the dressing. The fish wasn’t crispy :(
We loved it
Loved this
"The potatoes and salad were great! the seasoning on the chicken was tasty, but I didn’t enjoy the chicken thighs. The dark meat was too rubbery. This recipe would have been better with chicken breasts or tenders."
Horrible! By far the worst meal from all the different types of deliver to your door meals. Very dry and little taste.
It was a lot of work for an okay flavor. Option to add jalapeno's or something spicy to add more flavor to it.
Good flavour and easy to make.
Also nice flavours
rice was soggy and not enough cabbage
the peanut sauce was good but too liquid. No consistency
Simple dinner with bass fish
Sooooo delicious
Not enough seasoning for the chicken
very good
the carrots should be cooked
the amount of ingredients we received seemed wrong. The sauce seemed like it had too much peanut butter and was a much lighter colour than in the picture. The carrot we received was tiny and wilted.
"not original enough, flavour was underwhelming"

Portion of meatloaf was a bit small. Veg was delicious.
Was missing ingredients in my bag
Delicious! A small salad would have made this 4?'s.
Could have included a salad...
Sausage was a bit fatty and there was no milk given with the ingredients. I only drink almond or coconut milk so I had to borrow milk from my neighbour.
"Very peanut buttery sauce, could add double the veggie amount"
One of our favorites.. the dough baked up beautifully !!
Absolutely loved it!
"somewhere between packaging and drop off my fresh food got frozen, very disappointed, been ordering for years. One order my produce was not as fresh as it could be it had a worm sticking out of it"
I didn’t use any of the stems because I find them bitter. Very good.
A little bland.
Noodles a little mushy but might have over cooked it
A lot of green had gone off.
very good. Arugula was not 100% fresh
Orzo was awesome!
this was dry
Didn’t care for the kale
Excellent and easy to make!
"Excellent, amazing flavours. Loved the veggies tossed in pesto. Great idea of meatloaf patty."
"red pepper was old and looked to be going bad, not as fresh as other produce"
really enjoyed this.
"Great pasta, fantastic sauce. The rapini was a bit bitter, but otherwise good."
Average! Wish the yogurt sauce was more garlicky. Lacked the Greek taste!
Sauce was a little too dense
sweet potatoes not done and I did not toice in time to cook more before putting them in pan. Very generous portions though.
Quite tasty! just wish the salad was a bit more substantial or the sandwich was a bit bigger. We were looking for something else to eat afterwards.
I added shrimp since we aren’t vegetarians but I wanted pad Thai
Loved them.
The fishy was really mushy. This one did not work.
Jerk sauce definitely had some heat to it. Was good but my kids wouldn’t eat it. Squeezing limes for juice was like trying to get blood from a stone. Fortunately I had some extra on hand.
the cucumbers were rotten -too bad-the rest was lovely
Very good. Lots of veg.
There's no way the cheese curds could have melted properly without a sauce that's served hot.
My favourite
We were disappointed with this box and actually only ate the yam fries and salad. We love chefs plate and will continue to order but not fish ones
Good flavor but did not receive enough vegetables (per the measurements on the recipe card)
Surprisingly delicious. My husband and I both enjoyed it.
Very bland
"Tomatoes to much, little sour. Not really my taste."
Could have used more soya sauce
Pretty good. A bit more spice would have been good.
Excellent!
Great. Love the Pad Thai.
too many noodles compared to veggies
Loved the flavors. Perfect example of why I use Chef's plate. I'd never have cooked this otherwise.
Great taste!
Delicious flavor and easy to prepare
Overall quite good. I would add a little flavor to the enchilada sauce.
Easy to make and delicious
"could have used a little more sauce, had to add some of our own. otherwise delicious!"
"Way too many onions & other flavours were masked. I expect vegetarian dishes to include a good protein source, we so were disappointed with the selections this week."
It was good but produce was not in good shape. Shouldn't be called pad Thai bc the sauce was not pad Thai sauce. Should be called Thai peanut noodles.
We enjoyed the combination. It was good.
"I've tried ""easy to make"" pad thai before but this was easy AND delicious"
This was okay. There wasn't enough sauce.
"Salty, slimy, not good at all! we were super looking forward to this one too, and were extremely disappointed in the turnout."
"This was not very good, the flavouring wasn't very good, my husband said it made him feel sick. Despite the flavour not being great, somehow it also didn't really have very much flavor. Disappointed"
Meatballs were amazing! Great gravy and adding parm cheese to potatoes was super yummy.
very good for a vegetarian option however would have been better with beef as well
Would be even better with some veggies.
chicken with it would have been perfect
"This was ok, but wasn't my favorite."
Love the fresh pasta!
Pretty tasty
Soooo good!!!
kids loved it!
Distinct taste due to spices - some loved it and some didn't - but there was enough for 5 people.
Delicious
meatloaf appeared to be dry.


"Loved the combination of flavors, very easy to make after a busy day."
A little bland.
May have been improved with using cream instead of milk.
Rapini was bad couldn’t use it
"Way too much peanut butter. It overwhelmed the dish. Also, ratio of rice noodles to vegetables was out of proportion. Should have been more vegetables."
"My shallot had mold in it. Kind of gross, but otherwise delicious"
My favorite meal by far. I loved the exotic flavor and noodles
"Yummy, but needed chickpeas to make it a more balanced meal (I added some). Seems like an easy way to up the protein content but keep vegetarian."
Would prefer vegetables with vegetable spice only
"fantastic quick meal. I'm a little weirded out by the potatoes though, I know they're pre cooked but it's just not that good. maybe look into mashed potatoes??"
coconut spice was not shipped. food portions too small
Recette simple et très efficace pour les soirs pressés
"Tasty. Cucumber wasn’t as fresh as we’d hoped, but useful."
easy and good flavor
Very meh
easy to make kids loved it
Was good but the cooking time for the meat wasn't long enough.
Carrots not great quality
Very good flavours but too spicy for me (did not pick this meal). Not enough for 2 people.
It was really good only thing is we would like more gravy.
delicious! i only wish it came with some meat very easy to put together
"They barely give enough ingredients. Maybe give you 1 ounce of cheese. Produce sucks, as usual"
Very disappointing meal and kit was missing an ingredient.
"would have been better with fresh pasta, but otherwise delicious"
Chicken could have been smaller pieces
"So much rice, cabbage was not Napa. Spice was flavourless."
Pretty tasty.
LOVE THIS
Flavourless
we enjoyed this. though I wasent a huge fan of the sauce
Sauce could have had more flavour but overall good amount of food and quite good!
Not enough meat for 4 people
"The pasta was great, but I am only giving it two stars because the salad was not edible. The greens were covered in a slime and brown. I had to throw it out. Disappointing and a waste of the extra money."
Salad was phenomenal but needs more fig jam
Was ok but not amazing like some of the other meals I've had
really easy and tasty
Very good
Rotten carrots
"Delicious but the meatloaf fat runoff smoked in oven quite a bit at such a high temp, maybe too much fat in the ground beef? Still tasted amazing."
YUMMY!
yum!
We got dried pasta and it wasn’t orecchieete. Soooo disappointing.
"So easy, delicious, and made 4 large servings!"
"The meal was good. Would have liked more salad, only had one small cucumber with the tomatoes. Not enough for 2 people."
ok - could have used another vegetable
I was so angry and disappointed when I went to cook this meal and the chicken had gone bad and the mushrooms were nasty too. I had to go buy the stuff to still make the dinner
Meatballs were amazing!! A really good dinner
"Neither my husband or I liked it, sadly 90% went in the compost."
Wish there’d been a head’s up that you weren’t providing milk/cream anymore - I had to make a special trip to the store for it. Meal was delicious.
Beans and salsa were good. I liked the amount of vegetables in this recipe. It kept me full for a long time. Assembling it was kind of awkward
Again another delicious meal but all the ingredients weren't supplied so had to go to the store for milk :(
Was not great did not taste at all like pad tai. Going to cancel my account
One of your best. I added ground beef to it.
Need a green vegetable.
Delicious! I love the homemade tzatziki so much.
This was great!
"Chef's plate should consider packaging the spicy spices separately. That way, people like me who don't like a lot of spice can add what it desired. These red pepper flakes completely overtook the dish"
pure quality of the noddles
Fish didn't really get crispy but it tasted good.
family favourite
Didn’t care for the meatball seasoning
this was fantastic. I hope they offer this again very soon!
"was missing some Italian spices, but it was delicious just the same"
"So yummy! So simple. I wouldn't say it was spicy, but very delicious!"
missing olives ??
Fabulous!! I will order this again!!
Easy to cook and delicious.
not enough gravy and flavour in the meatballs
Was missing the tomato paste and I didn't have any on-hand. My package of pork seasoning was open and I lost some and my pepper wasn't very fresh. Usually on a Wednesday everything is still fresh.
The honey garlic pack wasn’t sealed properly and made a mess in the bag and we didn’t get our sauce.
"Not enough gravy , but delicious"
Not the best one I've had.
Not worth the money. Didn’t come with enough carrot.
Yummy
So bland! So basic. Definitely not worth the price paid.
quick and easy.
Our favorite so far !!

"threw out siriacha, hair in it. didn't need it. pretty tasty"
love the addition of the balsamic vinegar
This recipe was less disgusting than the last one with Katsu sauce. But anything with katsu sauce is still gross and going on the never again list.
"We haven't had this yet, however, the picture makes it look good. We are a beef family and look forward to this dinner tonight"
"Loved this, had it before from Chef's plate and it is one of my faves! My only wish would be just a bit more of the low mein noodles for this recipe. I also like to add onions and garlic! :)"
mayo was too spicy
"Super easy to make, great flavours, and my kid wanted more chicken!"
It was very good. Would have liked a bit more sauce to pour over top of the meatballs.
A little too simple
Please redo the instructions for this one--they were unclear and almost sabotaged the meal. The fish was excellent!
good
not good at all
delicious
"Oil not needed with pesto, too greasy"
Was really good but not enough meat to feed 2. Also the wrong recipe was sent in the box.
Is was a bit bland and the carrot was so small.
"I didn't like the salad much, and I thought there was too much spice, but the idea was unique and delicious"
This is a family favourite!
The chios we done and tasty but not crisp. Didn't like the tartar sauce.
delicious!!
I enjoyed this meal. Very flavourful
"Not a big deal, but, for information purposes. ...wrong recipe received for ingredients"
We both didnt care for the kale but the sweet potatoes and porkchops were delicious
Sauce had too much peanut butter not enough spice. Larger portions are way too much for 2 seniors. More than 4 meals.
Just ok. Slightly too bitter. Could have used a protein like chickpeas other than the large amount of feta.
Quite tasty. Takes much longer to cook than indicated so plan accordingly.
"Very tasty, nice spice kick."
Les morceaux de poulet avaient un peu de «tiraille».
Amazing taste and lived the cabbage and carrot combo ????
Vraiment très bon
Fancy Shake and bake
The greens with this dish were totally rotten. We couldn't eat them. Otherwise delicious
This was DELICIOUS!
Crisps were dry and had no flavor
Definitely not a winner for our family. I think if it had white rice it would have helped a lot. :(
I was really disappointed with this recipe. The barbecue sauce was completely out of place and overpowered the dish. All I could taste was be sauce .... will be cancelling my subscription .
This was lovely and easy to make.
Dijon flavour was overwhelming
Ratio of breading for the chicken was not enough.
Something New and very tasty!
needed way more plum sauce
Green beans with Parmesan would be great!!
Nice just not enough food.
"the potatoes were horrendous. the instructions said to cook for 5 minutes, they were raw and hard still."
I really thought I wouldn't like this much. I expected to eat the vegetables and nothing else. I have never made anything like this or tasted flavours like this but HOLY CRAP! It was amazing!
tastes like a bland chili
amazing meal! one of our favourites!
there is one part of the recipe which says take 1/4 water from pasta ... which I didn’t find clear where to put it. I noted later 1/2 cup of warm water was put in the pasta - was this meant to be the same thing??
Super yummy. Wish I had a full list of the ingredients in the shawarma spices to replicate on my own!
really yummy
"It tasted delicious! Unfortunately, we got a really small piece of cheese, much smaller than the last time we ordered something that included it."
it was gross. especially the biscuit - why does it need cajun spice?
Super tasty!!!!
I wasn't overly fond of the slaw. It was a little plain for my pallet.
Same price and not much protein
Repeat this one please!
delish
Amazing!
The biscuits needed way more time then allotted to cook tho.
I think spinach would have been better than kale. The kale was a bit “tough”
this recipe was great but the cornstarch and recipes were missing from our order.
this had no flavour and was very hard to eat. I am not a picky eater either. really hoping my other two meals are better this week or we won’t continue this service.
"The entire plate was awesome. To be honest we were not looking forward to the biscuits but they were simple to make, tasty and a perfect texture"
"not impressed. very gingery. no garlic, no zing, no bam"
Delicious but not enough meat for 4 people
Delicious
"Better than expected, and it was expected to be amazing!"
"all the ingredients were good, and the recipe was easy and straightforward. I didn’t love the flavor of the sauce but that was mostly my personal preference. my husband liked it more"
not enough sauce
awkward combination of rosemary pork and overly acidic apple chutney
great flavors!
Kale salad was spoiled. I've been compensated.
"we added dill and some cheese on top, as it is a little bland, but still a delicious, filling, hearty meal."
"Very tasty, but could use more sauce so it covers everything"
Excellent!
Not a big fan of Kale
The recipe called for tahini but none was included in the box. The flavour was still ok
Absolutely delicious. Wished there was a bottomless bowl. So good.
the jerk sauce is deelish and super spicy!
Way too many sweet potatoes and kale. Not my favorite.
"Took one bite and threw this out. Unfortunately, the bun was too small to house the contents of the sandwich. I did not feel any of the flavours complemented one another. Texture was off."
Good but for the family size I have to cook meatballs twice as long as called for and add more like 1.5 cups of water to the sauce
This was an all time favourite for everyone!
the beans are to die for and the mash was amazing. The seasoning in the meat balls was not the best. 4 stars to the vegetables 1 star on the meat overall 3 out of 4 stars.
Good but too much peanut butter
Did not get my food so sad
needed more beans
These meals are so bland and not what we are used to getting from chefs plate
"Very small portions ,"
Very tasty...perfect blend...would have loved to have had more of the salsa..it was great
more vegetables would’ve added some texture maybe some nuts as well?
Spicy
A little bit spicy.
salad was a bit sour
delicious. would add a little aour cream to serve
Tasted okay.







Better the next day.
Maple syrup not included
amazing
awesome!
"I love vinegar, but this meal was way too acidic:( Super disappointed"
"Salad double the size pictured, meets Canada's food guidelines. Fish mushy, will not get it again. Fries good."
Chicken was very fatty. White meat preferred. We may stop ordering meat as the quality doesn’t seem as good anymore.
awesome! really enjoyed this one
needed some more cheese
the sauce had a bit too much vinegar
taste very good
Les carottes ont souffert du froid à la livraison.
"Skeptical about this at first, but thoroughly enjoyed this product"
Slaw was a bit bland
Yummy
Yummy! Great Friday night easy dinner to make
one of the best recipes I think I’ve made! love it! added a touch of feta to the cucumber tomato salad and it was awesome
"unfortunately, I found the sauce for the gnocchi to be vinegary - i realize it was a balsamic reduction but i was hoping for more of a tomato flavour."
Delicious and amazing portions !
This one tasted good but the sauce didn’t come together without some extra help (was way too thick to encorporate). Adding to pot and not to pan for recipes like this don’t turn out well for me.
Loved it - so pretty easy to prepare
Amazing
Too peanutty - felt like it needed something but not sure what - was good though
could have been bigger. still hungry
Delicious and easy to prepare. Too bad we got dry pasta instead of fresh pasta though. Had to trim a lot of fat from the chicken thighs. Would have preferred breast meat.
A bit more veggies would have been nice.
OMG the orzo!
Terrible
Good tasting Italian dish that you can make at home that's actually good for you too
The flavouring and cooking of the dish was excellent! We really enjoyed the seasoning on the chicken.
Avacado was still not ripe
cucumber was bad
"really good, the sausage was a little spicy for some members of the family"
"This was a perfect meal, the portion size and flavour was great"
too much onion and green pepper for us!
Only complaint - needed more veggies and more sauce!
THIS IS SO GOOD
"This was very tasty. I don't know if I'd call it a Pad Thai, as it was more of a peanut noodle dish, but still very good!"
Easy and tasty
It was awful
Produce cane old and moldy. Will not be repurchasing
Too much balsamic vinegar so it tasted way too vinegary.
too peanuty flavoured
Produce was not fresh this week. We made it within 3 days of delivery and couldn't even make the salad to go with it - had to be tossed out
"These were ok, would have preferred to make the jerk dice on my own as it tasted very processed."
Loved it. Was excellent
Second week in a row that carrots were bad (soft and mushy)
did not like the kale everything else was great
Good but needed more cheese to stop the tortillas from being too crispy.
a classic
not enough flavour
Simple and taste
"Chicken was not very flavorful, need more cucumbers"
One of our favourite’s!
Calzones were amazing! The salad was not a family favourite.
Sweet potatoes tasted like the plastic bag that they came in.

it was delicous
Wasn't a fan of the texture of the fish. The salad and fries were great though.
All was good with this recipe except for all the peanut butter used for the sauce. I made the noodles “gummy” and it basically tasted like noodles coated in peanut butter. It was rather weird.
"Too many noodles, not enough ingredients to make enough sauce"
Very good - a little more sauce and spice would be good

Everything was good and easy to do but we all felt that there was way too much balsamic vinegar in the sauce. It overwhelmed the other flavours and left a vinegary aftertaste.
Quality sucks! Spinach was wilted
"Amazing recipe, but the corn tortillas don't maintain their integrity when re-heated."
Chicken tasted good but was fatty and out of all the potatoes we received only 2 could be used. The cucumber arrived frozen and was garbage but I have been compensated for the cucumber.
Simple and delicious!
"I added shrimp, was really good!"
Fish was not very good at all. Did not flake when cooked.
Tasty
It was ok
We had to replace all the vegetables because they were all mushy when they arrived
It was boring
"Surprisingly good. Could have been a creamier, cheesier sauce"
Was good. Better as a lunch than a dinner. However it was too salty.
Chicken was good. Pitas were of poor quality.
Could use more veggies
Delicious!
Cucumber was smushed during delivery. We had to buy a new one.
"I did not like the ""mushy"" consistency of the fish. The outer crisp was food, but even after cooking longer than suggested the inside was unpleasantly soft."
Needed spice and more flavour.
Needed more spice.
Kids fav
This was just okay-Ive had better bowls before
portion was so small! cucumbers were laughable in size
"Yes! So good, and salad was good too!"
this did not taste very good and we didn’t finish it due to the taste. not happy with this recipe
loved it
So easy and delicious! We ended up tossing the cabbage slaw into the pan to warm up with the rice and beef - amazing!
Great
"Salad was delish, fish was good"
Loved the rapini. These meals all incorporate vegetables I don’t buy myself and I always enjoy them!
Only 3 pieces of chicken for 2 people....
needed to be spicier
Not great for my kids.
Need to use milder onions....they domineered over all other flavours
veggies were quite different meatloaf turned out very dry
Enjoyed the diversity and mild spice to this dish
Very tasty!
Very spicy but good
"Fantastic, creamy, and lasted longer than a meal usually does."
Loved the creamy sauce.
Noodles were sticky and didn't mix in well.
Sauce was a bit dry
"Quick and easy to prepare, there may have been to many herbs for the amount of food, they were a little overpower."
Was nice and quick from start to finish. Literally 15 min! Pretty tasty
"I didn’t like the texture. I found the noodles stuck together. It was a big sticky clump. Yes, I did rinse properly. We cook witheh these noodles a lot. Wasn’t a fan of the flavour either."
"The buns were a disappointment. They are hot dog buns, not subs. The buns were way to small."
"Cucumbers and potatoes were rotten, otherwise, recipe would’ve been good."
Very good
A little too tangy
"The recipe was good, but we preferred when the meal came with milk. We opted to order Chefs Plate because we didn’t like food going to waste. We had to run out to buy it and we don’t use milk enough to use it up before it spoils."
"Good meal, appropriate portion sizes and healthy menu. Not crazy about the precooked rice so would like to see it in a normal 30 min version."
Portion size was very small for this meal
Out of the first 3 plates- THIS ONE was the best! It was even better the next day..BONUS

"Good, could have used more rapini."
Pasta not as shown. Faux cheesy milk sauce was odd. Fresh rapini though.
Ingredients were missing from the bag
We substituted mushrooms for artichokes because we don’t like artichokes and I think it worked much better that way.
These were very filling and easy to make.
We really enjoy this meal . Will make this again
This gave me and my niece husband food poisoning! We made it the second day we had it. Extremely disappointed in chefs plate
"I threw out the potatoes and cucumbers and used my own, the"
Our box was missing the arugula for the salad
Not good value. Salad not appealing
I had to add ingredients to make it tasty. This one was a disappointment
"excellent, the fish was light and fluffy and the salad dressing was very good."
fancy but easy. great comfort food.
"Really enjoyed these. The jerk spice was perfect, flavorful with a bit of kick. Mixed with the cabbage slaw, gave the tacos a nice crunch. Very good."
"This recipe was weird. fordt it said kimchi, and there was no kimchi. Beef shouldnt have been groubd beef, and the pre cooked rice was strange."
The glaze made the pork so yummy!
Got the wrong recipe cardsGot the wrong recipe cards
The carrots were old and soft. Not what I have come to expect from Chef's plate.
not enough onion filling for sandwiches. I had to add my vegan pulled jackfruit to the onions.
The vegetables were delicious
The texture of the noodles with the peanut sauce seemed off.
The chicken contained a lot of inedible gristle - not the nicest!
A bit too spicy for the kids
Needed a protein.
Flavourful but fish could have cooked longer for crispier texture
Flavorless- both the slaw and the main dish. Very disappointed
Meatballs and sauce were tasty. Not enough veggies. Just starchy veggies like potatoes.
The sweet potatoes were not cooked enough and did not look like the picture until we added a lot more oil and cooked much longer than the instructions.
Would have probably preferred normal basmati rice as opposed to the quick one
I was given red onions instead of shallots
Surprisingly good!
"Very disappointed. Very cheap ingredients. The recipe included onion which wasn't in the package. Overall, this might be a snack at the bar but not something you want to have for dinner."
"Despite the mishap of this bag, the recipe was tasty. I’d probably make more sauce and add moreveggies next time, maybe even some meat or seafood. The sauce/veggie to noodle ratio was off (to many noodles, not enough of everything else)."
why is milk not provided??????
this was all good!
Mush
This dish was tasty and balanced
pesto veggies were great but the meatloaf was bland
boring flavour. kept getting too dry
"For a Korean themed dish, the spices were lacking with this one."
It was too peanut buttery
A bit too bland.
This was pretty tasty!
potatoe portion on the small side
"Creamy but not too rich. Easy to eat, even my little brother (picky) liked it and I liked that we could incorporate some vegetables into it."
we enjoyed the salad but the large pasta was quite doughy. flavour of sauce on its own was okay.
"Family Fav, for sure!"
cucumber and tomatoes were rotten by the time we used the meal (5 days after delivery)
Amazing flavours!
"Easy, delicious, great variety!"
parmesan cheese made everything really salty
It sucks that you don't use fresh pasta anymore and or provide milk.
quite tasty - better quality fish would be nice
"2 huge servings, enough for leftovers"
a new favorite with the whole family!
"great, except carrots were soft and mushy. Had to throw them out and use my own"
Needed shrimp or egg
Not enough sauce provided too dry.
TOO many Carrots & not enough spice
Just ok.
Very good. My son loved the chicken and biscuits. I loved the chicken and coleslaw.
Nice flavours
This will be a summertime go to.
"This was neat! Loved the cheesy potatoes--can't go wrong with that. Portion was huge, too. Good value for $$$"
"There could be a better description of how to coat the chicken in the recipe (i.e. dip in buttermilk then in crumbs, instead of just mixing it all together)."
Biscuits were great.
"Really good, just wish a better bun was provided, and not just a plan burger bun."
moldy!
"Bland and tasteless, no spice!"
Another amazing meal. Different from what I would make but we loved it
"The potatoes were undercooked - even after we microwaved them for several minutes, they were still inedible. Really disappointed, especially as we paid more for a 'quick meal'"
"Very good...a hit with every member of the family. Leftovers for lunch tomorrow, too! Maybe one or two more potatoes would have made it a bit thicker and heartier."
Maybe add some salsa
Was expecting fresh pasta
Easy and delicious
Terrible. Rice was disgusting. Had to throw it out. Inedible.
Recette délicieuse! Un petit détail n'était pas clair dans les instructions : on conserve 1/4 tasse d'eau de cuisson mais on rajoute 1/2 tasse d'eau tiède...
Picky kid liked it too(!!!) Worth repeating
This was a spectacular meal! This will be a repeat for my husband and I for sure.
Fantastic flavours and very tasty.
Veggies were fresh. Flavours were nice. Disappointed with the dried pasta after being spoiled by fresh pasta. The cheddar didn’t blend well and made the ragu chunky.
too greasy. recipe should have the cook drain the beef fat rather than leave it and sauté the veggies in it.
I would cut back on the amount of time you roast the veg before adding the cheese the veggies were a bit overcooked and I had to leave the cheese in for longer otherwise delicious !
Was yummy but was very spicy. Half the currey paste would have been good. I added chicken also. Maybe add a spicy measure to the meal description? i couldnt feed this to my daughter.
we miss the fresh pasta noodles the dry is not as tasty or quick
steak was mostly fat- I buy two meals a week for many months this was my first disappointment
add seeds to salad to add crunchy texture. also a bit too much vinegar for the salad
The worst dish of the week. The millet and fish were super bland. We took a couple bites and threw it out. Plus for the second time this week we had rotten ingredients. The mint and tomatoes both wete unusable. Pretty disappointed with our first week trying Chefs Plate.
"Once again, the pre-cooked potatoes were undercooked. We ended up cooking them our own way, with our own spices. The steak was gristly and the salad was plain and relatively tasteless."
Lots of flavour and texture. Very satisfying
If I had cut the beef strips and broccoli in smaller pieces I could have gotten double the servings. This was a very generous portion.
Nice change.
"Wasn't enough to eat. The stuffed rather inadequately. Perhaps, the sides should've been wrapped inside?"
"loved the tacos, nice flavours but the slaw was a bit bland. overall I would make it again"
It was ok. Hubby cooked it.. beans and potatoes were not cooked. He didn’t like all the plastic
coating was really salty
Loved this. Way more flavourful that I thought it would be and so fast! My partner thought it was a bit spicy. I'd say it was a mild-medium? Really good!
not enough food for 2 people
Really delicious flavours and huge portions - we had leftovers for days! it would have been nice to include a protein like some tofu or egg.
small salad with this would have been nice
"The fish was supper tasty, moist and boneless!"
Wasn’t the greatest the dough become very greasy
loved the fries!!
"Sauce didn't look like the picture. I took out half the pb and it was still way too much I couldn't taste the spicy or the soy, just the PB. Also the veggie cooked down & were gone. Bowl of pb noodles"
"Not as flavourful as I expected, and lacked veggies etc."
"Although the pasta was fresh, which was nice!"
"The recipe was delicious, but the quality of the food - produce is declining. Please include pantry items in the ingredients again."
good flavour
Meatballs fell apart while cooking them
"While this was tasty, one chicken thigh for each person was an insufficient protein portion size."
"Love trying new flavours that I wouldn't find at my local grocery store, yum!"
The one tiny cucumber we received was bad (the texture and colour were like it had been frozen) so we could not use it for the salad. The chicken wasn't a good cut of meat and I got sick from it :(
Ok flavour. Would be better with some sour cream and avocado.
Did not get the same pasta as shown in recipe. Also the recipe is wrong.
Yummy. Have loved most the bowls I've tried
"Very bland, just tasted like peanut butter on noodles"
"This was the first recipe from Chef's Plate that we didn't like. The noddles were mush, there were hardly any vegetables, and all we could taste was peanut butter."
"Good, but doesn't quote feel like 4 meals worth."
Veggies were so good. Meatloaf wasn't super flavorful but still delicious.
I added ground turkey - super tasty
great flavor - too hot for my kids
Just ok....
lime and soy were missing had to run out to the store to get
Definitely recommend this one!
Amazing flavour on the chicken!
Easy to make and tasted really good.
maybe a couple more potatoes
More katsu sauce next time please.
just meh. kinda flavourless
amazing - small portion though
delicious
The pasta photographed is no orecchiette
Fish had good spices but it didn't turn out crispy at all.
enjoyed this
Carrots were bad. Had to throw them out. Meatloaf was bland. I liked the pesto sauce on the potatoes.
Don't like basa.
noodle clumped up and could have been tastier

"No much flavor , kinda boring."
could have used some protein like tofu
Everything was delicious.
The dough was a bit hard to work with
"Disappointed in this one, the side salad should have had feta with it and the produce was not that fresh"
"great flavours, easy to make"
only comment negative would be that the jerk sauce could have been more authentic
Beginning to become very fond of orzo and couscous
We weren’t overly impressed by this meal
it was really good
"Again, very good recipe. Inclusion of a 'yellow' pepper instead of a 'red' pepper as described/imaged...eroded overall colour of dish/experience."
The salad needed something! feta/pumpkin seeds/cucumber.
"The jerk sauce is absolutely incredible, love this dish!"
Wasn't a fan of the flavor of the gnocchi but my boyfriend liked it
This recipe was good and the portion size was better than most meals with Chef's Plate.
So far our favorite
The flavors were great with this meal but I found the portions really small. I had ordered the meal for 2 and there were only 5 smallish potatoes and 4 small pieces of chicken.
Recipe was good. Becoming less impressed with chefs plate for having to provide my own milk/butter/etc. I don’t often buy milk so bad to delay making this dish until I had purchased some
This wasn’t my favourite. The pitas didn’t soften up at all and the flavour was just fair.
Pork good-- Kale tasted bitter and the sweet potatoes weren't cooked through
Love the sauce. Gnocchi was easily mushy. I left boule for 3 minutes which was too much. A bit disappointing.
Missing two ingredients—soy sauce and ginger paste!
I found this to be pretty bland and boring...
We like all of the pasta recipes we have made to date!
Needed more vegetables. Cauliflower or snow peas
excellent
"This needed more time in the oven, the middle was lukewarm. Also the top tortilla dried out even with the cheese on top, could have used some sauce over the top."
"Nice flavour although the cucumber was less than fresh. Limp and soft. Also, no Greek yogurt in with recipe bag supplies ??"
"seemed to take much longer for meatloaf to cook, partly because hard to fit two sheets in oven it affected cooking/air flow and so lots of smoke from fat/grease and nearly sent smoke alarm off"
it was tasty and easy but the dough never really stretched out even with waiting and it was really hard to divide in half and you could split some dough off one ball once first divided
Found this to be dry. Would like a side salad with the meal.
Would prefer if pasta came with a salad. I always feel like I need to make a separate vegetable or salad
The whole week was great but this one took the cake
"Instructions were bizarre and confusing (around using reserved bean liquid). It was awkward to layer, awkward to cut, and awkward to eat. The corn tortillas were very dry."
My family loved this meal!
Really good and flavourful
We absolutely loved this!
"Good, but I found both sauces vinegar heavy."
Not a lot of flavor maybe needed some spice

Would have likes a more bok choy.
Little bit greasy - chicken thighs a little fatty.
"Good flavours, healthy but smaller portions than usual"
"Unreal recipe, week later we are still talking about how delicious these were."
A bit bland
This was so good. A little too much spinach for me !!
It was difficult to cook the noodles and the pepper at the same time. Ended up overcooking the noodles and slightly burning some of the pepper. But still a good taste.
Tasteless salad and not enough Marinara
Great meal!
Quite good.
this dish was missing a protein! like some tofu.
This recipe lacked in flavour and wasn’t very spicy.
"This dish was amazing, even my young daughter enjoyed it! My only 'complaint' would be that the size of the salad was very small for the two of us so I ended up adding some tomatoes and cucumbers."
The 'sauce' was not much of a sauce in terms of consistency. I followed the directions to a 't' but it came out very thick and I did not have anything on hand to thin it out.
"Peanut noodles might be a better description.....because this isnt pad thai. No fish sauce, no tamarind, no spices!"
Not much to the meal..

Cucumber was spoilt
"The chicken and potatoes were amazing, as was the garlic sauce. The dressing on the veggies was not my favorite. The veggies were too soft, might have been from being outside in the cold."
"The recipes was tasty, although it came with a different type of pasta than the one in the picture."
"Great recipe! Packed with flavour, and the sauce gives a nice touch of savoury to the dish."
I like things a bit spicier but it was flavourful
"The sweet potato fries brined really fast even though we followed the directions, otherwise very tasty."
sides were excellent. would have preferred chicken breasts.
delicious and easy
Produce was mush before I even got to make the meal . Pretty disappointed
Really enjoyed - the pesto vinaigrette was delicious.
Wonderful! A definite one to repeat!
Way too much balsamic to marinara. My dish was dark brown.
The sauce was really thick and the noodles were quite sticky
Salad was a bit boring
"severely lacking vegetables; the 2 premature carrots barely provided colour. Needed a side salad, insufficient quantity of food"
"It was super yummy, but for the first time it did not seem to be enough food."
fish didn’t look cooked even when I cooked it over suggested time. we ended up throwing it out
This was comfy food. I added some beets because it didn't seem enough veg. Much of the pesto was left over in the bowl.
Great dough...came up crispy. I foulnd the chili peppers spicy but my husband liked them - maybe if we could have had them separate.
So so so so SO delicious! We will make this recipe again and again
"Got the right meat, the wrong ingredients bag. Looked at my next door neighbours order, Simple mistake."
Chicken was low quality - quite fatty and grisly.
"Great Flavour! I underestimated the importance of draining, or pat dry the fish before baking - ours came out soggy. I would also use 1/2 the spice next time."
The food was easy to prepare and had great taste. The family experience in the kitchen was priceless !
Super quick and easy to make! I think it took me 10 minutes! Tasted yummy too.
my favorite of the week! Loved the kick of the jerk sauce!
Loved these! Just wish there had been more wraps.
"On this particular order, the beef was not shipped. Used my own however and the meal was delicious."
A little weird. The shells on top curled up before I baked it.
"Really good, would love a bit more seasoning though."
needs more sauce please
Way too much peanut butter in the sauce. It just tasted like peanut butter noodles.
No dough provided
Dry. Was ok
I absolutely LOVED the pesto and vinager combo for the roasted veggies! Would love to see this in other recipes!
"The pork was tasty, but the package was leaking when we got the shipment. The rest was ok. Sweet potatoes are not my favourite."
It was really good - had never had rapini before - delicious!
Delicious!
Very tasty and easy to prepare
Delicious especially the next day lunch to be included!
Didn't like. The sauce had too much vinegar (I should have reduced it more than 1/2).
"Very good, but I would have liked it spicier."
"delicious flavours, however meat portion small (how does 2 people split 3 things? shouldn't there have been 4 thighs??)"
Delicious and flavorful.
Fish was not crisy but mushy
the cucumber and tomatoes were pretty soft and squishy.
"Large portions, very filling. Tasty recipe."
Find would like a different dressing for the salads as it is always white wine vinegar
not tasty and very runny
Easy & delicious
Found this boring and tasted just OK. I also didn’t realize the chops were butterflied and was confused when I was cooking them if I should open them or not.


Wonderful
I loved it...husband hates Greek apparently...lol
"The air-tight packaging on the rice brick was super messy and I was very unimpressed with the amount of time I had to waste breaking it apart, cooking rice would have likely saved me time."
Enjoyed the pesto vinaigrette on the veggies ...

These were good!
"missing all spices, very bland. No tomatoes either. salad boring."
Loved it!
"loved the chicken flavor, yoghurt flavor could have been better"
Delicious! Absolutely loved the yogurt sauce!
Omg I loved the sauce so much (and also the gnocchi)
This was also excellent as leftovers
The chicken was not great quality meat. The roasted potatoes and tomato salad were excellent. Great flavours!
very bland
missing apple cider vinegar pork and sides were good
a bit too rich but tasty
Was very good...wished there were 2nds
"Called for way too much olive oil in the tomato and cucumber salad, that’s all you could taste."
"We found this a little bland, just ok"
"We were given 2 portions of sweet potatoes, they were not cooked to be soft enough. 4 ms cook time per side of pork chops left them dry and chewy. We did not like this meal at all."
Not enough flavour for the pork chops.
Didn’t realize basa fish are bottom feeders and not the healthiest of fish to eat. Wish ithe fish quality was better.

could have used a little more spice but the recipe is definitely a keeper
Very spicy
I’d prefer chicken breast
Flavorful. Could have used a little more corn and less cabbage.
very tasty and easy to make!
My red pepper was rotten on the inside and there were too many green beans.
Loved the yogurt sauce.
Philosophy pastry would have been better
Bland
eaay Buns could have used some butter or more sauce.
could have used a bit more sauce:)
this dish was delicious and plentiful
Didn’t care for the jerk sauce taste. My husband didn’t either
Delicious!!!
delicious!
"Bit too much balsamic for my liking, not crazy about gnocchi."
"Need more vegetables, also my pepper was orange not red which is not as flavorful"

"Had never had Pad Thai before...loved, loved, loved."
Great quick meal. Super simple as well. Definitely enjoyed!
"Good, but not mindblowing, which is what I have come to expect from your Asian dishes."
This recipe was so spicy my family could not enjoy it and we ended up throwing it out. Noodles also were over cooked following the recipe card instructions. Very disappointed and will be going back to other food deliver services.
loved it! yum!
"Quick and simple, but a disappointing. For the amount of spice mix that went into the ground chicken, they were surprisingly unflavourful, and the salad was boring. Good if you like bland."
Bland tasting
Please start including basics staples like sugar and butter again.
Délicieux! Très simple à faire!
"Le plat est bon, mais plus complexe qu'il n'en a l'air. La panure s'appliquait très difficilement sur le poulet et collait dans le bol."
Tasted good but biscuits were very runny and spread out and chicken coating was not enough to coat all the chicken. I think I was missing ingredients.
"I would have rated 4 stars, but the directions on the recipe cards were not as organized as they usually are."
"The fish itself was tasty but I've added more vegetables to the taquitos and salsa to accompany the dish, otherwise it would of been really simple."
was not enough for 4 people
Very flavourful.
Delicious. Really good re heated the next day for lunch too. Great portion size.
We love the mexican dishes
The burger was flavourful and juicy and I just love the homemade caesar dressing! Another delicious meal!!
very good
"Love it, except for the carrot fries. Carrots don’t make good fries, they are better raw or mixed in with the rest."
delicious!
"This was amazing, so flavorful!"
I got a moldy lemon with my box.
an unfortunate approximation of kfc
Zero stars. Couldn't make. Cauliflower was rotten upon arrival.
bland and didn't have cheese
fantastic
This was SO delicious and easy to make. Great mix of flavours. Enjoyed it a lot! Would love to make it again
Outstanding flavors and paired well together! Easy meal to prep. I will definitely order this again!
Very good!
Very good - it's a keeper!
"okay meal, not terrible but not great"
"The whole family loved this meal. My only comment would be that stripping the kale took about 15-20 minutes itself, so prepping the ingredients shouldn't be considered in the ""30 minutes"""
We didn't enjoy this meal at all. First one that I didn't finish. Is it possible also to actually specify how much oil is a drizzle? Thanks!
The Zaatar was not very noticeable.
One of the tastiest ones yet!
Flavours amazing. Cooking times half of what they need to be to roast veggies.
"Pork chops were amazing. The other was good, but I tend to avoid the pre-sliced 15 minute meals if I can because they don't taste as fresh."
Chintzy on cheese. Cheap bun. Not impressed.
Got the pork chops but two bags for the Chicken Shawarma so was not able to make this dish. :-(
"Very good recipe, salad is a little bland, but the burgers are easy and yummy."
The recipe didn’t state to put breading in a separate dish but to add it to the buttermilk which seemed odd but i did it. In the end there was hardly any breading on the chicken this was disappointing
very good
Missing cheese
Didnt care for the ricotta sauce but it was a nice simple dish to make.
Definitely one of my favourite recipes so far. The lime sauce is so good!
"not very appetizing, seasoning was ok. “salad” was disappointing."
Delicious and good portion size
The beef was way too tough for me. Flavors were okay otherwise.
"Chicken thighs, gross"
we didnt add all the spice and it was still way too spicy
That was a lot of wontons. Flavours were nice though!
enjoyed this meal very much
The poblano pepper was pretty bland and didn’t add much flavour. But loved the easiness and taste of it! yummy
Missing za’atar seasoning so not impressed
"Loved this! Although I would title it 'spicy' as well, I liked the spice, but others might not. Also added some of my own sour cream - good addition!"
too much spice without the flavor
potatoes were brown when we recurved the parcel so cooked this meal first. Steak was a very poor & chewy.
"1/2 star really-- interesting twist , miss with us"

"it was awful. so spicy, out of 3 people in the house we had to toss the entire meal NO ONE could eat it. we also didn’t receive the instruction book so I had to use the app."
This meal was delicious and super quick & easy to create.
The meat tasted good but too much tendon which made it chewy
"The portions were not appropriate. The steak was too small to feed 2 people and the meal consisted mostly of potatoes. The flavour was great, but the meal was disappointing."
Burgers lacked flavour
"it was excellent - a bit time consuming to prepare but we both enjoyed it very much! only issues were no tahini but I had some at home, carrot was soft and unuseable but I had some and Beet was soft but still good to use!"
easy and had good flavor.
it was simple and had decent flavor. there was too much carrot! i was sent these 2 GINORMOUS carrots and it ended up not being well balanced (rice to meat to veg ratio) the chicken had a lot of chewy stringy thinhs that turned us off. So far it would be our least favorite.
"the salad was amazing (fresh baby greens this time!) potatoes very good! the ribeye is not nicely marbled...the fat is tough, stringy, and grisly. more flat iron steak options please!"
needs to be labeled as spicy
We only got enough halloumi to get 3 thin “steaks”.
the beef has been fabulous thus far but sadly this was chewy
NO MILK!! I have been using the service for almost 2 years and there has always been milk. nasty surprise on my moving day as we had to rush out to get milk for what should have been a convenient meal
yum!
Very good however too spicy for some of family
felt this would have been better with rice or pasta. also spicier than I was expecting
Too spicy for our taste.
too spicy and tortilla chips seem stale :(
"I liked how easy this recipe was, my husband liked the flavour."
this recipe was really good and quick to make.
This was phenomenal
hubby loved it
Received wrong and incomplete kit.
The portions were very small and more suitable for a lunchtime meal. The chicken was so fatty I tossed it in the garbage. I used my own boneless chicken breast.

so good!
Wish there was more protein... Not enough lentils
This was easy and quick to make and tasted good.
"while the dish tasted delicious, and there were lots of portions, one of the ingredients was missing. The packet of seasoning was not in the bag. I ended up making the blend myself (quite tasty)."
Love it
"Missing items; pink peppercorns, garlic powder and onion flakes"
"The chicken burgers were delicious, loved the santa fe spice."
"This was easy and delicious. I wish it had been a little more saucy, but that's just because I'm a person who loves sauce."
Salad was very good. Steak was very disappointing. Two pieces that needed to be cut in half since it was a dinner for 4. Very very fatty. We all were hungry when we were finished.
Very easy to make and tastes divine!
Very flavorful but very high in salt - we had to leave out some curry paste to reduce salt.
loved the lime flavor
a great meal!
Salad and potatoes were really good -- the steak was quite 'chewy' and a lot of grizzle which was unfortunate as the steak meals are usually really good!
"The cut of meat was only so-so, you’ve certainly done better. Mostly gristle"
Good but too much polenta!
This meal would have been good I think.. I received it with bad ground chicken and bad spinach. I made it with ground turkey instead and the burger was good. I couldn't eat anything else though
Bland and boring.
Very good meal! Really like halloumi and the veggies were really good with the tahini.
this meal was delicious! will definitely make again.
excellent very rich and filling
"Taquitos were great, slaw was boring"
The cut of beef was very fatty and tendons so we were disappointed with this meal unfortunately. We will think twice in future meals to get the beef meals.
Amazing. Though I felt there were too few Brussels sprouts and too much sweet potato
"tasted great easy to make, but, missing the spice mix packet and had to use spices I had in my cupboard"
Fucking phenomenonal. Please put this on the menu again soon
more of an appetizer
This was tasty but too spicy for my child. He coukdn’t eat it.
Green Beens were still too crunchy after the time specified
"easy and tasty, poblano peppers were a nice touch"
really tasty!
"Steak meat was very tender , potatoes were sub-par,and salad was nice and light but the white wine vinehar package that is comes in was leaking from the side so the bag had a foul smell when it delive"
One of my favourite meals :)
Good amount of spicy to it!
Absolutely delicious!
was super easy to make and the flavours were amazing
Lots of flavour. Would certainly reorder.
The dijon mustard out powered the cabbage and carrots. Would only use a small amount. The chicken was a little bland. The biscuits
"Very spicy, which I'm ok with, but also bland. Needed a lot of soy sauce to make it edible."
Very nice. Tasty and wellflavoured
no flavour and just gross
"Really liked how many vegetables were in this dish, especially all the kale."
Too much fat left on skinless chicken
Sauce was pretty weird-tasting. Tahini and BBQ flavours didn't work.
Missing ingrediants - red peppers and mayo for salad.
The bok choy was wilted and this was cooked the day of receiving the box.
Ail manquant ... sinon delicieux légumes frais et repas savoureux!
"I loved the taste but to spicy i couldn't eat it all, buy Hubby loved:)"
"Beef strips may have been a better choice, along with a stronger flavoured sauce."
Didn't come with butter.
Perhaps peas in the curry or rice would have been better
Delicious. Every ingredient !
steak was grisley and fatty. The little that we had did taste good.
tasted great bit WAY too spicy
Easy to prepare and tasty.
"It was a very dry pasta, more sauce requires"
"Great flavour, completely enjoyed this one!"
"The recipe called for salt at every turn, but then the halloumi is already so salty that by the end the dish a little unpleasant. But tasty! The curry spice mix was DELICIOUS!"
Loved this!
potatoes needed more flavour
One of the best chef's plates I've had so far.
terrible
This was very good!
Very filling. However not worth the price charged.
Potatoes and salad very good and sufficient amount. Not enough ribeye and it was tough.
The biscuits were kind of flat although it could have been baker error!
"Very nice, satisfying dish."
easy and lots of flavour
Très délicieux. Le mélange d'épices à donné un goût incroyable au poulet.
Amazing. I little heat but not overwhelming
This turned out better than the last steak dish we tried. Potatoes were a little weird - maybe they were cooked in broth or something?
"The rice noodles were tasty and I liked the sauce but I could barely taste it after a few bites because it was SO SPICY. Like, not a little spicy, but inedible. I threw it away."
excellent spice!
Gross.. most went into garbage . Son wouldn't eat and I don't blame him
I'm so disappointed I was so excited for this recipe and when I was cooking I looked and you missed the noodles how I'm gonna make chow main without noodles?
"This was great, except there weren't enough Brussels sprouts."
Cooking instructions did not provide oven temperature!!!
Everyone loved this. Definitely would remake.
Good.
added some chicken. was very good
I added some broccoli to the soup. green was a nice touch.
That was delicious!
small portion for 2 and could use more ingredients like beans
Really enjoyed it. Great flavours and textures
Although I liked it my husband found it way too spicy. Instuctions on how to modify the spice level would be appreciated.
Tasted as good as it looked! Lovely apple chutney!!!
Bland...needs a protein.
The steak wasn’t the best
"The tortilla chips were flavorless, like cardboard. I would rather this recipe with some nice bread. Spices were amazing!"
"So spicy, I saw the label but this was spicier than anything i've ever had so I couldn't eat much of it"
Weird tang with the tahini
"Really carb intense, not very macro balanced"
Exceptionally simple and delicious
Very good however it had a kick to it that was a little too much
C
You did not deliver! Very annoying
This wasn’t great. The meat was not good quality- really fatty and sinewy. The potatoes were undercooked and hard. We left most of this meal- what a waste.
Dont care for the tortillas
Not at all enough food for dinner
If I could give this a 0 I would. The steak was 90% gristle and so low quality it was inedible.
Seemed a little bland
"This was delicious, but too spicy for the kids and gave 2 of the adults a stomach ache, definitely too spicy for the ""family box""."
Not a lot of flavour
BBQ sauce made it too sweet
These were delicious (I was actually surprised at how much I liked them!)
The carrots were very low quality. Was expecting a better dish
"The ground beef was a little disappointing in this recipe, should have been steak strips. The the sauce and veggies were really good though"
Chutney was nor used as was not appealing
Ok.
Good but was missing the broth in the recipe
The steak was not a good cut so a lot had to be cut out prior to cooking. The salad was good and the mayonnaise dip for the potatoes was tasty.
Not much flavour. Was odd with ground beef. Should have been beef strips.
steak was gristly
Such a tiny portion of Halloumi
The driction can be a lot better. As well a little more meat
Meat had little bone shards and dressing was lacking for salad. I was most excited to try this one and we were very disappointed
You should have put for the sauces to your taste. As it doesn't tell how much to put in. Imy mouth was burning.
Quality of chicken has being going down. Too much fat on the chicken and now I’m getting frustrated with the quality of the meats - steaks have also dropped in quality.
"The flavours were bland and I find it unacceptable to receive dried pasta in a food kit. Even with a busy schedule, I buy or make fresh pasta. I will be sure to avoid all pasta dishes in the future."
Needs more ginger flavour!
Awesome!
Flavours were odd.
This was overall a good recipe except that my my potatoes came grey And inedible.
Very good
"the avocado was not ripe and there is no ""harmony"" in this recipe. ingredients did not go well together"

maybe another sort of pasta would have been a better choice?
Simply outstanding Burger- salad dressing could have been a little more exciting
Complicated and cools too quickly
liked the halloumi and peanut sauce
"Lovely, taste heightened, lean , and a favourite now."
Potatoes were not cooked

There was a bit too much Kale and looking back I would add it gradually.
Excellent and easy to prepare
Loved it
Had to put dressing on salad. Other than that was good.
I personally added a step to roast the noodles to add some crunch
"Needs a bit more flavour, kinda tastes watered down"
"broth thin, flavours not the greatest"
"The meat was tough and fatty. I did not enjoy it, or believe this was good value for the money"
Delicious. My husband and I LOVED the burgers and the spice.
"Consistance trop pâteuse à mon goût, mais mon conjoint et fiston ont adoré!"
Potatoes were average but rest 5*
The pasta shape was awkward...
Steak was tough.
"Fantastic flavour, but one of the less filling/substantial recipes. Perhaps add beans next time?"
Amazing! I was surprised how good this was.
The beef was far too grisly .
Wrong noodle for the sauce
Needed a bit more sauce. Very spicy.
"Flavour was good, but the cut of Beef was not a great quality. Very tough."
So easy and delicious!
Received chicken thighs and not ground chicken. Purchased chicken and made the recipe and it was good.
Meat was quite tough and I had to throw out half of the potatoes as they went bad after 4 days
Steak was a bit tough and potatoes too soft in middle
"did not even eat this, was an auto selection that would have not choosen"
Toooo spicy. Should have made a note to only use half the seasoning to season to taste. And we like things spicy.
"decent burger, salad was underwhelming"
had to throw potatoes away as grey and mushy also came in incorrectly labelled packaging - steak was fatty and well below chefs plates usual standards - and this all in the week when we had to call to get pdf recipes emailed as none in box - bad week for chefs plate definitely on last chance now with competition ready
More tortilla chips
Delicious! Loved it!
please please add more sour cream and guac! but spices were perfectly spicy!
Perfect.

a lot of kale
Very good abd easy to cook
Think it was my fault. Did not do well cooking pork chop.
"made this 5 days after receiving it, same day as it’s best before date. Carrots and beets had already gone bad and were unusable. Very disappointed as it all should have lasted that long. Otherwise it tasted great"
Beef was frozen and stuck to bag
The meat portion could be a bit bigger for two adults.
it was way too spicy for my family there should be an option at how spicy you want it
The whole family loves it and looked forward to a few leftovers for lunch!
the steak was a bad cut
Too much sweet potatoes
I would not have bought this had I known it was ground beef. Not a great stir fry
The portion of halloumi should be double the size.
Delicious!!
Mashed sweet potatoes were very dry
Blah. Very blah.
The flavor was good but the steak had a lot of gristle
Just lacked a little flavour
Flavour was great but it was way too spicy
"The quantity of cabbage provided was excessive, and the suggested dressing of just lime was unappealing - not interesting enough."
It all went in the bin. Too hot and the noodles quickly went soggy
bland
This is the best Chicken Vindaloo I've ever had.
"Little watery,"


Great flavour combo with the Halloumi.
"Simple cook instructions, but not enough veggies and flavour."
One of our faves :)
"Did not get three ingredients mustard, vinegar and rosemary"
Too spicy ??

.the steak was fatty and very chewy and would not recommend because of thus
"Everything was ok except the quality and quantity of the Brussels sprouts were not good. A lot of them, I had to carve out the bad parts and we weren’t given a lot to begin with."
Not quite enough vegetables. Really appreciated the carrots coming chopped up already.
Delicious!!
Not much flavour
It was a little plain
This was delicious! Will make this one again for sure.
More saucey.
Dijon flavour was too strong for the coleslaw and the biscuits were a bit too much herb flavour and chicken didn’t get so crispy the way the recipe was written
excellent flavor
Would’ve been better with beef strips rather than ground beef.
The dressing on the salad was too acidic though but still very delicious
Enjoyed!!
The flavour was better after I used my emulsion blender.
Very delicious! Very easy cooked in an electric wok.
"Spricy for kids, maybe a note on spice in the recipe."
Chicken pieces were so so

"Although it was marked as such, it was still a bit too spicy for my liking."
spice mix was delicious
Flavor was great but the steak was a bit fatty.
Very Good!!!!
Delicious! SO many fun flavours in one dish
Really enjoyed it
Enjoyed it
Everything was awesome
steak was very small portions for 4 people plus it was extremely poor quality . Mostly fat!
needed more veg stock reduction
would have liked more ginger
I don't love brussel sprouts but the apple chutney sauces was AMAZING!
That sauce was AMAZING
"Managed to substitute the cream with some lactose free cream, and it was still super delicious!"
"I loved everything except the sauce it tasted very watered down...I think something was wrong either recipe said too much water or we were suppose to get more soya and ginger, maybe packed wrong?"
We didn't quite make the biscuits right not sure what we did wrong and I don't like the taste of the salad. I liked the flavour of the biscuits.
Awesome
"a little confusing to make, took longer than normal because of the lunch portion"
I found this a little too saucy and slightly bland.
Loved this. Only negative was not having the printed recipe card this week.
Delicious and very filling!
A little greasy but otherwise OK.
"The chicken and biscuits were absolutely delicious and I love that it was all prepared in the oven. The slaw was lacking some flavour, however."
"These. Were. Delicious. I love that they were prepared in the oven as well, it was very easy! The dressing on the warm potato salad was unreal!! Our favourite meal from the box this week."
"Not a very good cut of steak, seemed like a low quality steak, not a top rib eye that we were expecting."
"did not come with noodles, so a bit of a miss"
steak was fatty and very tough
Easy to follow recipe. Simple wholesome ingredients
Super Yummy!!!!
"the sauce was really bland, I tried adding my own seasoning, but it was that helpful in this case."
to much pasta not enough vegetables.
Loved it.
"The meal was good, but the bun was a bit small & plain."
Steak is never really the best quality but still good
Loved loved loved this recipe.
Okay. A bit too strong flavour.
Very good!
The burger was good but it was very rich and could use a type of pickle or acid to cut through the richness
Loved the salad - more than the stir-fry!
Stir fry is suppose to taste good. But the stir fry sauce tasted horrible and using mince meat instead of steak strips is a terrible choice.
"the single best Chefs Plate meal I’ve had. Spiced golden crunchy cauli, yummy cheese, two sauces.... so good. this should feature on your menus more often!"
Nice flavour
Still not enough sauce.
"It was a little bland, next time I would make it with garlic."
"steak was bad quality cut, too fatty!!"
"I might add shrimp or chicken as it felt like something was missing, but great flavour and very filling"
My favorite this week...more please
"Would be even more delicious with more mushrooms and a bit more sauce. Overall, fantastic taste and easy to make!"
Even my fussy kid loved it!
It was missing the rosemary and the garlic seasoning :(
"Flavour, colour and texture very nice. Needed to supplement rice."
"Little bit soggy, smelled more appealing before adding the wine. Concept seemed good, tasted alright in the end, but not definitely not a favourite."
4/4 on everything - loved the added touch of tortillas
The steak flavour was good but had lots of string of fat in it so very hard to eat
Farr too much mustard on the coleslaw (was overpowering).




Found this a bit watery. The veggies also could've cooked for longer than recommended; we found them a bit hard still.
it was ok. portion sizes are getting smaller
BBQ sauce is a large portion of the sauce mixture.
The burger itself was great. I was really disappointed in the salad. Half of the lettuce had turned already and had to be picked through and thrown out. I had more feedback but not enough room. Fail.
"Interesting, fusion flavours. Technically not a chow mein but really like the dish!"
"in the salad, spinach overwhelmed the rest of ingredients"
Very yummy!
We really enjoy Halloumi but did not love the flavors of this meal
"really good, and he salad for lunch was great too!"
Wow! I will keep the recipe card and make this again.
"Good flavour, liked the turkey!"
perhaps personal taste but this recipe was just Okay. followed directions but pork was quite tough so I would suggest cooking with a thermometer not based on time
portion was too small. Not enough cracked wheat and beets.
Amazing!!
Wish there had been more halloumi
"Someday I'll learn to cook pork without it being dry, but even with the dry port, and I added a touch of nutmeg to the sweet potatoes, this was a winning dinner."
Did not care for this. Lacked spice. Did not care for stir fry with ground beef
This was decent and easy. I was impressed with the flavours for such a quick meal.
great family dinner. No leftovers

This was excellent. Even better left over !
"Delicious, simple meal"
Wouldn’t order this again. Meat was not great too much griddle & fat
"I love Chefs plate, however I am concerned about the amount of plastic in each order."
nice and easy to prepare
love all your fish tacos
very tasty
just alittle too spicy suggest 1/2 spice for some
All parts of this dish were great and we would love to see any part of it again in other dishes (especially the mashed sweet potatoes)
loved the flavours
"Not a great taste, peppers too spicy"
"Taste was good, portion was very small. Had to add ingredients to feed two people"
"I've had a couple good gnocchi recipes from here before, but this one wasn't great."
"I really enjoyed these, but a little bit of cabbage was not enough of a side dish"
Potatoes were a bit mushy even after the cook.. still great though and quick which was key.
Tasted ok but not enough food for this one. We were still hungry
Excellent taste. Easy direction.
was very good but the chicken did not arrive with my package
huge portions and i loved it !
"Loved it! Didn't like that the bbq sauce contained MSG, so we didn't use it. It tasted great without the bbq sauce."
I have a sensitive stomach and ANY hot spice is too much for me.. was unable to tolerate the spice.. but my husband loved

Delicious
the sauce for this was SO good!!
Needed cheese and a side of rice
was disappointed with these. i felt there should have been more ingredients in the taquito itself. the slaw was boring
Really different. Super tasty
Steak was grisly the rest was good
"carrot was soft, had to use one of my own"
This was delicious!!
Beets needed extra time than indicated
My first time cooking halloumi and it was delish! Looking forward to trying another dish sometime soon.
Needed more halloumi. I would make it again but with less garlic.
Added grated Parmesan when serving to bump up the flavour.
A little too spicy but 2out 4 family members enjoyed it.
Flavor a bit off - not sure why. Liked the convenience of dinner/lunch option.
Zero stars if I could give that! Meat was complete inedible - chewy. Ended up throwing it out. Potatoes also has a strange aftertaste - also thrown out.
Kids devoured this one.
stuffing did not fit will in shell
Really really liked this one. Yum!
Delicious
"The meal was really good; however, the ground chicken arrived spoiled. We tried cooking it the day after it arrived and the meat had an odd smell. We replaced it with some ground beef we had at home."
First time ever having anything like this and it was my favourite
Not enough steak for two.
Love green curry
Loved how chewy the cheese is! Will order again
"the hot pepper was extremely spicy, I had to leave it out."
Not a big fan. Found meal lacking in taste and substance.
This was soo good - I now will be looking for baby bok choy in my grocery store to make it again! The baby bok choy was so much easier to cook with!
"Very good, although it wasn’t very filling."
We prefer roasted Sweet potatoes to mashed so I made that slight adjustment. The meat was very yummy!
Very flavourful and a nice easy dish to replicate again on my own.
loved this one. It was so easy to make and tasted delicious
There was an awful lot of griissol around one end of the very thin steak. And we only fried it for 2 minutes a side instead of 5. We roasted the potatoes instead of broiling them.j
"I was looking forward to this one, but found the soup to be very bland. It was hearty but almost tasteless. A lot of salt and pepper helped."
Wish it was actual beef and not ground beef
Pre-packaged potatoes were very moist. It took extra backing time to cook out the moisture.
"Good flavor, not enough sauce even when you double."
Nice and easy. Would prefer a real beef to cut. Not ground beef.
A tad too spicy for me!
"Great! We stretched it out with another can of tomatoes, mushrooms and beans."
"The dish seemed rather soggy, so that the different flavours were not tasted. Also, for just 2 people there were a lot of noodles."
We didn't get fresh pasta for this like the ingredients listed. Instead it was dried pasta.
Simple and very good. I did add chicken :)
Delicious! good combo & tasty.
I didn't use all the spice down and added chicken and it was very good!
Was very good but we were still hungry- needed a bit more hallouimi and one more vegetable
While family loved this recipe
The apply chutney was delicious and the pork was very tender.
Sweet potato was really small and old
Not enough meat for two adults
Really tasty. First rate dish. Just wish I had broken up the mafalda pasta a bit for easier eating.
Really good flavours
Very tasty and delicious.
Perfect amount of spice and a fantastic salad! My 2 year old loved the burger!
"The spice burnt in the pan and create this unbearable smoke. I followed the instructions. Also, they were just kind of a hassle to make. And too much cole slaw."
My greens were rotten as were my potatoes but that issue has been addressed with customer service.
Would have been better with steak rather than ground beef. Needed more flavour.
Very nice
One of my favourite recipes so far! The portion of halloumi could have been more generous though.
Steak was too chewy
The tortillas were missing - but not sure it would have made much difference .. but not enough food .. my son was hungry after.. usually portions are very good ..not this time ... taste ok
Steak was a little tough with lots of grizzle.
Really disappointed with this new service. Way too many noodles and not nearly enough veg.
"Recipe was very tasty, there is just not enough for a family of 4 (2 teenagers). I would order again if you could add another person."
consistency wasn't very good and definitely wouldn't consider this a chowder.
This beef was the worst cut ever. So chewy and would not break down after minutes of chewing.
Tasty and filling
Dish was spicy but recipe card did not indicate it would be. It was on the family plan but kids could not eat it.
"Too sweet, maybe mix real potatos"
Would have liked more dressing
excellent but too many noodles
I am rather disappointed in the way chefs plate has gone with their packaging. The containers and bottles used were so much easier and you could reuse them for so much. Now most stuff you can't reuse
The choice of oils makes a difference- make sure you use one with an appropriate smoke temperature (I used coconut oil and it smoked like crazy)
Terrible. Worst meal we have ever had from chefs plate
Delicious!
Beef was open and it was missing an ingredient
My absolute favourite. Loved the spices
"Very good meal, simple to make!"
would have been better w/o red wine flavour
very tasty and easy!
Delicious
"Delicious, kinda healthy, easy to make. Would have swapped the wheat for quinoa"
Great meal
Flavourful. Interesting take on a burger.
"good, could have been creamier"
"A lot of prep, but delicious!!"
Did not get meat for any meals this week.
"the spices used in the burgers in combination with the poblano peppers and the jalapeño cheese really made the burger taste amazing, I was initially worried about the buns being too small but they were actually perfect and much preferred over the usual ciabatta buns."
the fish was very tasty and I’m very happy that the cabbage now comes shredded already.
The salad dressing needed a little something extra.
amazing flavours and good sized portions.
One of out favorites
Really tasty
I really enjoyed this although the amount of meat sent was very small . Not enough for 2 people
Add some bacon with the Brussels sprouts!
This dish was amazing
This was very good and easy to make... my kids lived it too!
Too spicy for my family and we like spicy.
I think I was expecting a bit more flavor. I love brussel sprouts but found these very bland and the apple chutney was uninspiring.
"Juicy, tasty chicken burgers."
Good taste although I added panko crumbs to the ground chicken. Meat stuck to paper towels
"Enjoyed it all, Potatoes came out very crispy - loved them."
Loved the combo of spice and savor!
"It was fantastic! Will be going into my ""make again and again"" recipes. Fantastic dish for anytime but ESP when have vegetarian friends over"
cheese portions were very small
"The pepper was way too spicy, I tried a tiny piece of it and it was beyond fire. Also, no matter how much I washed my hands after cutting it, some of my fingers burned all night."
Spicy and delicious! Would order again!
very good
"steak was very small, and fatty."
I feel like it could have been a bit spicier.
Terrible. we've been long time Chefs Plate subscribers and were extremely disappointed with this. the chicken portions were tiny. the cucumber was too small and was rotten inside.
Not crazy about the chicken thighs - too stringy.
a little starchy
minus the salmonella pepper it was very good.
Steak was a very poor quality and the potatoes were almost black.
Tasty and really easy to make
Could use an additional pepper or another vegetable since there's no protein.
"very good, easy to make, but spicy, you have to like spice. and i do"
"Perfect ingredients and perfect taste :-). Makes my life so much easier, love Chef's plate!"
Needed cilantro
I got food poisoning.
not very flavourful
Delightful textures and taste. Guaranteed favourite!
My husband enjoyed this more than I did. The salad just wasn’t my favourite.
This was our first meal and we loved it. Easy directions and the timing was perfect for each step.
food was delicious and portions generous. my nine year old said it was the best salad ever. recipes was fresh and flavourful. I felt like a superstar serving something other than spaghetti for dinner.
Mixed reviews from husband and I. Lentil soaked more of the liquid than pictured and came out more mashed like than soupy. Good flavour and very easy to prep.
"Flavourful, healthy and good balance of meat and veggies. Would definitely order again."
Package/meat was leaking. No recipe cards.
Wasn't my favourite - the flavours didn't quite work for me
So tasty and very easy to throw together
Way too spicy!! Would have been amazing itherwise
"""meals were great however no recipe cards was a huge inconvenience """
lettuce wasn’t super fresh for lunch
Hot but not much flavour.
"This cut of meat was disappointing, fatty, and flavouring not as good as past steaks."
So tasty!! Has a bit of a kick in the spice.
Nice Chili and healthy with the turkey. You’ll like it if you’re a fan of chipotle.
Loved the flavours of this dish. Quick and easy. Chicken required trimming up to meet specs prior to cooking.
The instructions weren’t clear on how long the pork has to stay in the oven
"They were a little bit spicy for us, and a bit too much sauce."
Not filling enough.
Loved the spices and the potatoes were crispy and perfect!
Felt more like a soup. Not enough chips to jumble.
too acidic
Almost a 4
the recipe on the app was incomplete and had instructions in the wrong order or missing!
"This dish had a nice balance of flavor with the vegetables and tahini dressing. I always use less than half the garlic supplied, as I find there is always too much. I've already made it again."
pretty good. really easy and tasty.
Great flavourful sauce
This was incredibly disappointing. The steak was so fatty and full of gristle that we threw half of it away and were left starving after it was all said and done. Very disappointing.
Pretty good but a bit too spicy. Might have been better with a bit of peanut butter in the sauce
"I really liked this recipe, but it was missing a little kick!"
Enjoyed the perfect amount of spice and smoky flavour.
"The whole meal was delicious, steak, potatoes and the salad....AND dinner in 15 min! AMAZING! I might chop the rosemary next time to realease some more flavour."
Good....peppers very hot...
sooo good!!!
It would have been better with chicken breast.
"the taboulleh sauce did not mix properly, it seemed to curdle and was not runny enough to drizzle so the couscous tasted bland and dry"
The salad and potatoes were delicious but the steak was a little tough
"I added a little too much Chili sauce, so the heat was a little over the top for me."
very good
Should have said to break up the noodles. Noodles were not fresh pasta as recipe said. Still tasty.
Liked the spicy flavors of the stir-fry and the sesame dressing of the salad.
It was good but could have used a few more flavors like peppers inside of the taquito
easy to make and very tasty - could have served 3 for sure or 4 - generous portions.
"piece of meet was bad, very dry and chewy, had to throw out :("

"Bland, not very flavourful. Disappointing."
Learned how to cook brussell sprouts in smarter way..liked them together with chops. Did not enjoy the strong flavour of the Rosemary and wished it had been ground.
Please include more veggies!
A little too spicy for us
"corn chips were really blah, need a bit of salt or spice..."
This was very spicy but was very bland tasting.
Very disappointed with this meal. All 3 beets were mouldy so I was unable to use. The carrot was soft so luckily I had some I recently bought. I enjoyed the sauce. I would not order this again!!
bad cut of meat :(
very poor quality steak
"Very flavourful, and the salad for lunch was great."
"Good flavour, creamy, easy to prepare."
a little hot for me but good
"was good, but didn't realize it was vegetarian - needed some meat!"
Needed to by a little creamier and a little bit more cheese would have helped.
Way too much noodle for the amount of sauce. Flavour was meh (possibly because of noodles). Broccoli was already going bad only two days after delivery.
Spicier than expected
"good and easy, but I wouldn't make them again. The guacamole was mediocre."
Delicious! Would definitely make this again.
The meat was not lovely. Very tough.
Not enough rice for four people.
Outstanding!!
Needed a little more sauce. Maybe thicker sauce but tasted great
Very bland
Love love love
Super good

Not sure I was a fan of the salad dressing
SO EASY and tasted amazing!
The taquitos were great. The red cabbage slaw was a little lack luster.
Delicious!
to spicy
"Barely any sauce, very basic."
This was a really nice dish
Sauce was not great... Cooked for an extra 10 and still didn't thicken
Too much tomato flavour.
"Turned out to be my favorite of the week, even though I didn't think it was going to be. Sauce was great."
"The Pasta wasn't fresh like you used to do, I was disappointed."
More spicy than we though it would be.
Pork portions were quite small but otherwise tasty
Delicious but needs more protein - otherwise this is just a side dish. Portion of cheese provided was tiny.
delicious -- the pepper was too ripe but i replaced it with one of mine -
Loved how easy they were ... added some cheese to a few of them and they were even better !!
Inedible meat. I had to spit it out.
"Amazing flavour, only con to the recipe is that the noodles were too big. Should have a smaller noodle with it"
Our steak was missing but we went out and purchased one and followed the recipe and thoroughly enjoyed !!
Way to spicy for a family
"Massaging the cabbage was new to me, and so delish"
salad was a bit boring and small
Delicious
loved this one !!! my favorite for sure
Too spicy for our taste. We should have used less green curry paste
Meat too fatty
"potatoes were grey and steak was unbelievable tough, not a meal we would order again"
One of the best thus far. Delicious
Was ok - nothing special. Kind of a standard chicken stir fry dish. Didn't like the salad dressing and the chicken we received had a lot of gristle.
delicious!
maybe include more veggies for the salad
"I loved the recipe, I added clams to make it more New England."
Family hit #1 recipe of the week!
Could use lettuce or something more to add texture but very tasty
good hearty comfort food!
so easy to prep and delicious!
"Another great recipe! Super easy, very flavourful and delicious. Would absolutely order again."
Not what I expected. Did seem like it was the same quality of dish I have come to expect from Chef's Plate.
The chicken received with the meal kit was spoiled - had a very foul odor and made the whole meal inedible :(
Baking the pork tends to make it dryer than it should be. But flavours were good.
Amazing. This was so good. Not a fan of the pre-made rice... it was all torn instead of being nice long grains. But flavour more than made up for it.
Delicious
Tip for whoever packs: Pack bread at top and don't squish. The buns were completely flattened.
would be nice with a salad.
"Perfect amount of spice, making the recipe not only easy but super delicious!"
"My husband and I found it a bit bland although my children really enjoyed it. Again, the portions were small - I have two growing boys!!!"
cut of meat was poor and did not like the roasted red peppers.

Horrible. No flavouring
Really tasty meal. Hoping you’ll offer gluten-free options and/or thin buns to cut down on the amount of bread.
"great, needed more fish"
Don’t like Indian food. Liked the rice
It looked so good but just had okay flavour
Would have liked a bit more vegetables in this dish
spicy but otherwise no flavor
Brussels sprouts roasted too much by doing them with the pork
I wish there had of been a bit more cream to make it saucier. Enjoyed otherwise.
This could have been better with higher quality Buns
Delicious !!
This was delicious!
Delicious ...
Tasty but a bit too runny. Reserved 1/2 c pasta water but it didn't give further instructions what to do with it. Is it part of the sauce? More mushrooms would have improved taste!
The cut of beef I received wasn’t very good and extremely small if it’s consider a 2 person meal! The salad wasn’t that great! The seasoning for the steak was good though.
Absolutely delicious
very very spicy.
"Better than expected, very delicious"
Could have had more sauce
"Tasty both times, although a little over-spicy for our tastes. (Used just a hint of the garlic chili sauce) I like the dinner-to-lunch idea a lot"
"Delicious, hearty soup. I would have loved a cheezy biscuit or garlic bread instead of the plain bun. Would definitely have this meal again! Perfect healthy comfort food!"
Super easy to make and very tasty!
"This had really yummy flavors. Loved the charred poblano peppers, loved the applewood smoke spice. Didn't love the bun"
Very basic meal. Bland.
Noodles were a bit large and ours needed a bit more liquid.
We found it too spicy with adding all the spices. If we made it again we would add less spice.
Nice and creamy
"Knowing this was a veggie dish we decided to serve it as a side dish with beef. No-one in our group of 4, for a formal dinner party ate more than one bite. Too spicy."
Really disappointed with this new service. Way too many noodles and not nearly enough veg.
steak a little chewy
Fantastic! Love the flavours!
"great flavours, lots of veggies. There was mold on the halloumi though so maybe not so fresh? Cut it off and ate it anyways and it was good."
"excellent flavors very easy to make too much kale though recipe said fresh pasta, I received dry no big deal"
"I didn't enjoy the sauce, and just used Hoisan instead."
So tasty!!
I am rather disappointed in the way chefs plate has gone with their packaging. The containers and bottles used were so much easier and you could reuse them for so much. Now most stuff you can't reuse
Was very tasty.
The meat was not good. Lots of gristle and hard veins of fat.
"Sent chicken thighs, couldn't even eat this."
yummy!
I find the rice difficult to reheat without burning. Easier to make from scratch.
Lots of flavour
Good but would need a few adjustments to make it even better.
Steak was not edible...salad not good at all! We basically only liked the potatoes!
"Not a favorite of mine. I found it a little bland and the noodles way too large. I also would have preferred the kale to be chopped much finer, but that's personal preference."
The bag of sherry exploded before we got it so we had to make it without. Seemed a bit plain
It was good but again the rice vinegar exploded and so we had to do without. Tasted like it was missing something.
Well balanced when you added the Chili but my wife found it too sweet without (she ate hers with none)
Delicious sauce and easy to prepare! Love fresh noodles!
Very tasty.
very yummy
"Not convinced by this meal. Seemed light on ingredients, and calories. Watery. Sweet potatoes exceptionally small. Flavour good."
Ok
salad was soooo good.
"I’ve never tried kale or leek. It was not bad, but I know I wouldn’t remake it with the amount of prep involved with Kale"
A bit spicy...
Very spicy! Couldn't hardly taste anything other then the spice..
very tasty and so easy to prepare
My Husband really liked this. I found it to be a bit to spicy
Fish was super tasty wish it was more crispy and the sweet patato fries took a long time to cook still tasty but wish that was a bit more crispy too. Maybe specify how to cook them crispy on the menu.
Pasta was very pasty. Was first meal we ordered we weren’t crazy about.
Delicious and healthy
Beaucoup trop épicé Mais c'était quand même bon!
So delicious!
Was ok... buns were a bit on the stale side tho
The pepper was shriveled... far from fresh
Very watery with the tomatoes in there
Everyone enjoyed it! Rare occasion at our house.
Great
Very basic and not very flavourful.
Too spicy
Did not come with tomatoes listed in the ingredients list.
"Burgers were fabulous! Salad good, thought Dressing could have used more of a kick though."
It was tasty
Excellent. Juteux et bien épicé.
"This was great as well! A little greasy, as the beef was probably greasy, and maybe did not need the drizzle of oil? But enjoyed the meal!"
Lots of food but I didn't really enjoy the dressing on the salad
Wasn't as creamy as I like and needed more flavour.
Missing salad
"spice mix was missing, Salad wasn’t tasty and the taquitos were terrible"
Too hot
spicier than I would like
We loved it...
Loved this
very good
The spices were missing. The steak was not the best.
I just liked to add a few more veggies.
"I added more veggies which was great, but found there were too many noodles. The noodles stuck together."
Good recipe
potatos and salad were fine but steak very sinewy and hard to cut or chew. That was disappointing. Flavor good.
very nice
What kind of fish was it strange texture when cooked

"Would have been 4 stars, but just received an email RE the chilli recall ??"
we didn’t use the bokchoy and added hoisin sauce from our fridge but it was quick and good
Loved it!
The 15 minute advantage was precooked potatoes. Appreciate the speed but they were not great. Pretty mushy
Every tasty...don’t know if I’d add the bbq sauce to the mix next time. Maybe just tamari with the tahini for more flavour? Can the smoke be added some other way?
Not a lot of flavour...just spicy hot.
So spicy - not good for families with kids who don't like spicy food
It was missing flavour.
Tasted good but needed more kick and spice.
portion of sweet potatoes for 2 people was quite large... more veggies would have been better
"I added less water but still too watery. Decent overall though, but not enough flavour. Veggies very fresh and yummy!"
"Loved the flavour combination, very tasty"
Very pleased.
Spinach salad too bland
"was good, quite yummy. way too much ginger for me so I barely added any."
Salad was delicious
Simple yet flavourful and filling!
lacked distinct flavour that we have come to enjoy with CP dinners
I don't like wheat so had to substitute
Wish it was served with rice instead
the burger was delicious but the salad was weak
Wonderful blend of flavours!
Very good. We added muscles.
Amazing
outstanding flavours so impressed from tge sauce for potatoes to the simple but fantastic salad -we all loved it
This was amazing. Love all the flovours and the vindaloo spices and sauce were perfect!
"Bag contained skinless, boneless chicken thighs not ground chicken. Tasted great but needed a. Bit of adaptation"
way too much peanut butter made it very dry
Liked it a lot but could use a bit more flavour
"Found chunks of bone in ground chicken, hence the 3 stars"
Found it a bit too spicy and not quite filling enough.
the greens were a bit mushy and slimy
Was very bland
Perfect for a cold winter night
The meat that came with this was of very poor quality which was incredibly disappointing.
Appreciated having the red cabbage preshredded!
lacked flavour
not enough cheese too many veg
Brussel spouts were amazing... gonna do them like this from now on.
Didn't come with snow peas
"disappointed the salad was too full of decay to eat, otherwise a good dish."

















































Pork is difficult to cook on stovetop.
I used quinoa instead of the cracked wheat because of a gluten sensitivity. The dish was absolutely delicious...such nice flavours and colours
"La pomme était à moitié pourrie, j ai du prendre une pomme de mon frigo"
"Way too much spice! ruined salad, could have done with less in calzone as well."
Good portions and good flavours.
I didn't know it was going to be chicken tights instead of chicken breast like the picture suggests. The amount of chicken is not enough for 4 people and the tights had too much fat around. Sorry.
"The idea of recipes is good. The portions too small. My husband ate 1 whole of the steaks provided, if the portions were for 4, we only got 2 stakes that supposed to be for 4."
Very limited flavour
I would have preferred spinach to kale
Absolutely delicious
This is the second time I have had this dish and it is so good!
This one I will make again! OMG so good! Plus there was enough food for 4 servings easily
Did not get recipe cards
"Usually all orders are a hit for us, so it's probably a one off bad week."
Fish would have been nice in it. Needs more liquid
Delicious!
Fabulous
"Veggies tasty, meatloaf bland - needs sauce"
"Quick, easy and delicious!"
"Large portions but it had zero flavour to it, almost like a bowl of mush. I only used a quarter of the spice and could barely stomach it but that’s nothing to do with the lack of flavour. No taste"
Tasty and healthy. The sprouts were a little bland but no worries if you add your own seasoning.
loved this
"The dinner was yummy, but I did NOT enjoy the lunch. And I need to start substituting the cabbage for something else. It has a nice crunch, but I find that it gives everything a bitter taste."
First time having paella and it was pretty good!
pretty nice. a little salty
we felt the meatloaf was very bland and the veggies had way to much pesto
I added chicken to this. Really good. Nice and spicy!
I added garlic to amp up the flavour and my whole household finished their plates clean! Nice subtle way to incorporate greens that we don’t normally have on hand.
Just a hint of bar-b-que flavour very tasty
loved it!!!!
Not great a bit boring. And the rice stayed crunchy a bit even though I cooked it for more than long enough.
"The bread was good, though in general it was relatively bland. Could have used 1 more flavorful vegy."
Very delicious.
We heard we possibly ate leper’s with salmonella and found out through the news. Please explain why we weren’t contacted
Bun could have been better
Way too much peanut butter.

Not very saucy or flavourful. The term 'ragu' seems misleading.
This was NOT like pictured. Is was WAY too creamy with peanut butter.
Mushy basa

I baked them for longer than suggested but they were still soggy. I feel like there was too much moisture from the fish and tomatoes.
The fact that the red Thai chilli had a recall because of salmonella did not make me very happy to know that I may have salmonella poisoning. Also the orange pepper was partially moldy. And the meat
Also good but not great.
Yummy
We were short 1 tortilla :(
"For me, this was just okay."
The sauce with the gnocchi was only ok. The salad was quite good!
I think beef would be better than turkey
"The mayo was yummy. I'm not sure that the cabbage was better for being raw, or if I would have preferred it stirfried. It made me want chicken galbi, that's for sure. Could've been spicier."
very tasty did not think there was going to be enough for 2 people however there was plenty
The sauce didn’t coat the pasta well enough. It could have also been better with some meat.
This was delicious except that there was not enough sauce to cover the noodles. Next day it was so... dry... great flavor but not enough sauce. (Personally I'm a meat guy not just veggie)
"it tasted amazing and large portions. My only feedback as a new cook is the recipe confused me when it asked me to save 1/4 of the pasta water, but in step 4 is asks me to stir in 1/2 cup warm water."
One of the best yet!
Fantastic
so tasty
I love salad and sweet potato but not that much fish
potatoes were undercooked & not in good condition. kale was amazing
jamais reçu
great !!!
un peu sec
"Didn't really enjoy - the bean paste and sauce were flavourless and there was barely a sprinkling of cheese to call this ""cheesy"". wouldn't order this again."
I was surprised I enjoyed it.
Enjoyed the use of rainbow slaw instead of traditional things like cabbage. Much easier to eat without making a mess and still added a delicious crunch. Would love to see this used in similar recipes
Wish it had more flavor. But easy to make!
meatloaf is bland
"Bit tasteless, not worth my money"
Another hit - really good flavours super simple and delicious. Added extra cheese to the dish but that was the only thing lacking a bit for me. over A+
This was my absolute favorite!
it was spicier then I thought it would be. even when I excluded the Chili pepper
"This recipe turned out just to be peanut butter noodles, we ended up only taking a few bites then throwing the rest away as it was not good."
Just okay. Was hoping for real paella taste but this dish just missed the mark. A bit too much spice for my liking as well for a paella dish.
"To much balsamic vinegar, it overpowered the dish. Also, there was no basil like shown in the picture."
"Tasty. Only complaint is that cold cabbage/carrots/mayo sauce is put over the meat/rice, which cools the meal."
is there any way to prevent the noodles from sticking? i rinsed for a minute Toss in a tap of oil?
Good.. needed a protein
too small of small portions
it could have used more flavor in the meatloaf and the vegetables. I would have liked maybe one more vegetable with the mix.
Good recipe but snow peas and green onions had to be thrown out. ??
Hard to make. Lots of dirty dishes. But tasty.
"Once again cooking time was off. There needs to an indication of what pan goes on which rack and if the pans need to be swapped, etc. Once cooked, flavour was delicious!"
A little bland - and way too spicy - even after only using less than a third of the curry paste.
yummy! wish there was more ssamjang for the beef but still delicious. the slaw needed more rice vinegar which I had on hand
delicious!
Great! Only thing I would suggest is maybe an instruction to break the noddles in half!
Quite a bite to this - we ended up recooking the supper instead of making the salad - love the choice!
"I’m not a fan of pesto so I skipped that and used dried italian herbs, they were still delicious. Meat was tender, could use some spice"


Order was missing the Pork Chops!
Not good at all.
The noodles provided are different from the ones in the photo. But a tasty dish.
"Excellent flavours. However, recommend not sending pre-frozen meat."
Good but lacked flavor
very small portion - forgot lime
It was just hot spicy not flavourful spicy.
Didn’t care for the salad dressing but used my own
So delicious!! Please do this one again.
We couldn’t make this recipe because we were sent the wrong meal kit and the chicken was missing. You need better quality control on your meal kit packing.
"A little bland, would have enjoyed more seasoning, but still delicious!"
"the chicken with spices and yogurt sauce was absolutely delicious. unfortunately, the tomatoes and cucumbers we're already soft by the time I cooked them"
yummy! I'll make this again but make it a little more 'saucy'
We normally love stir-fries. Not this one! Ground beef doesn't work! Garlic - lime sauce was almost tasteless - too little for the amount of food it was covering. I would not order this again.
very blah... should have been served with chicken breast instead of thighs (or at least have an option). I found this new very disappointing.
"Very good but it would have been better with beef strips, rather than ground meat."
amazingly good
I accidentally left the review for this of the chicken Slovak
This was so yummy! I hope it makes a return on the menu options soon
recall on the chili
"Many items unusable for recipe, chicken small and fatty"
"boring. lacked flavour. All it tasted of was beans and tortilla. hard to assemble. needed way more cheese and contract of flavours. Texture was one note, mushy, not pleasing on the palate."
too much balsamic vinegar in both items
"needed more cucumber, especially since our came over-ripe"
Superb all around!
It was just ok. It was quite tangy. We added some leftover chicken to boost it up.
was not a huge fan of the meat
"the veggies were delicious, meatloaf was ok."
bland.
Delicious!
given that it’s only 510 calories I would up the cheese content and provide hot sauce and sour cream. over all good but the instructions need work.
WAY too spicy
A bit too much kale. Potentially include a note about needing a very large frying pan to hold it all when cooking the 4 portion size.
So tasty!
wow! a unique and delicious recipe
this meal was the best out of all 4 vegetarian meals we received
"good spice kick. very easy to prepare - rice just heat up, carrot was diced."
Awesome flavour! Easy to make and filling
Good overall. Dinner had food flavor. Lunch chicken was ok and the dressing was yummy.
Really great portion sizes. Good flavours
My delivery arrived with the meat packaging torn out and leaking into all the other packages.
"Not a big fan of the cabbage, but the rest was great!"
Potatoes were soggy even when cooked. Meat was fatty and grisly.
was excellent
Very easy to put together and simple ingredients and very flavorful!!!
beef was tough and fatty
Another winner! Comforting and tasty
Mayo was a little too heavy. One of the steaks was a little chewy
"I enjoyed the recipe, but thought it could have been a bit more flavourful - it was a tad bland."
Cook time for pork needs less as kind of dried out.
This one was so yummy! Easily a Top 10 for us!
The fish was not crispy at all. It was very mushy.
délicieux !
more cheese and cream for sauce
Too much lime. A little boring without a protein.
"fish was good, not very filling."
Meat too tough
"Possibly the easiest thing ever. It's all done in one pot, so the clean-up is easier, and the instructions were easy."
Was good
Decent flavor beans were almost bad...
My favorite so far!
these are a new favourite!! would be good over rice as well!
Fantastic!!
A very different but very good recipe.
Very good. Will get again
much more bland than expected
Very spicy but still delicious
I wish it came with more sauce.
Tasted great but the chicken had a lot of grissle.
I didn't make this because my green pepper and the tomato was not good to cook with. I had to throw them in the organics.
"would benefit from a protein source, sauce was far from a traditional pad thai"
"Not a hit. Parmesan didn't go well in salad. Too much vinegar, sourness?"
Phe.nom.i.nal!
top three of the meals we had!
Very tasty
Very good. A hit with the kids.
great flavours!
It could’ve used some spice but overall great!
chicken was very greasy
way too much onion and the pork had a strange spice
"From now on: if it’s dry pasta, I’ll skip picking it. Just not the same at all with dry pasta. Yuck."
delicious!!
"Delicious, and the servings were really generous"
Good.could be more in salad
more cheese needed
the pesto drizzle was amazing!!
Easy to prepare and tasted amazing
Tasty but a little dry; could use a little more spice
Delicious
These burgers are fantastic..love the pablo peppers
my noodle package open when I received it and so my noodles were all over the place in the brown bag and one of my potatoes ended up being partly bad otherwise everything was good
My kids thought this was fantastic!
This chicken was amazing! I loved it. I do wish the recipe had a breakdown of the 'greek spices'.
We liked this dish. But the baking took more than 10-12 minutes (almost 30 mins) yet the inside felt a bit raw.
"If I had of known the sausage was spicy, I would not have ordered it. I presumed the sausage was mild."
Good flavour but the neither the fish or fries were crispy. This recipe was better the last time we had it
"The mashed sweet potatoes were ok, but the rest was kind of boring."
tomato was too soft to use but tasty overall
"I enjoyed the use of pesto, but my carrots were floppy so I had to buy new ones."
The seasoning made the burger delicious
Sooooooo good.
The 2 small carrots were so old they were beginning to rot.
too much marinara sauce
"CP white-sauce pastas are always brilliant, especially the ones with sausage"
Way too much peanut butter. Was basically peanut butter pasta
I would’ve preferred natural/real peanut butter rather than the kind with sugar as second ingredient
Bland. More sauce
"A nice, hearty dinner! Great flavours!"
Very peanutty
tomatoes were no longer fresh
wish there was a side salad
Would have been awesome to included pine nuts for added crunch!
"Was delicious, would eat again. Was missing ingredientq, otherwise would probably rate higher."
Delicious! Would be nice to add a bit more protein though (Eg: an egg)
"I needed to put my chicken back in for an additional 15 minutes or so, otherwise this dish was perfect!"
"Fish didn't crisp up as much as I would have liked, but it was still delicious. The kids liked the sweet potato fries."
These were so easy and fun to make.
Meatloaf was dry.
good amount of noodles and veggies butbour order was missing peanut butter and ginger. was kind of hard to make the sauce without it
not sure how this was as my box never arrived!
awesome return on investment for time spent. really tasty.
very small meat portions compared to the vegetables
Delicious but portion was too small. I was still hungry.
was tasty but potatoes were moldy.
Love. Love. Love.
Really good!
I was really disappointed with the how oily the meat turned out to be. It has in the directions to cook directly in the sauce and the sauce had a straight up layer of fat on top. :(
"I felt the meatloaf needed more moisture, or it even would’ve been better as meatballs vs a meatloaf. Overall, the pesto was good on the veggies."
super easy to make!! will make it again
loved the tartar sauce
Minimal flavour
Really tasty but not enough meet given
Both meals were excellent
portions quite a bit smaller than usual but flavour good
meatloaf took way longer to cook than the suggested time. pesto very overpowering. but good flavours and easy
Pretty good. Didn’t like jerk sauce so didn’t use it. Corn tortillas would have been preferred to make it gluten free
OK but not my favourite
Never received the box...no help from customer service. They blame everyone else but their courier service if your box goes missing. Becareful using chefs plate.
Loved the vegetables! Great dish overall!
Very good!
The pork chops sizes are way too small. My 10 yo boy who is a small kid had to eat 2 chops to be satisfied. My husband had to eat 1.5 following a protein guide we have. We're all regular size people.
"This was very disappointing. Looks much better than it tasted. More mushroom and more of mushroom sauce, for us the kale ruined the dish- I used less than half and there was still too much."
everything about it was easy and delicious
Not enough veggies and too many noodles (instructions should be to add only as much as you need).

Really yummy. Probably could have done it without the milk!
loved it!
Did not get recipe cards
a LOT of lettuce.
"was ok, not our favourite, lack of ""stuff"" compared to noodles."
Too much pasta
so easy and fast!
So delicious!
THis was delicious
This really should have used strip beef. Nobody wants ground beef on noodles.
Excellent. The pesto addition to the roasted root vegetables was genius. I could have eaten it all night loonnnggggg!
One of my absolute favourites!. I've never tried Halloumi before and it was delicous
Always love the pasta casseroles
"The cabbage slaw was really lame and the fish was really spicy, even though i used 1/3 of the seasoning."
Poblano pepper were a wonderful touch
"By ground chicken smelled bad, had to replace it with beef."
Sauce did not taste like Pad Thai but in general the dish tasted really good!
I added a little onion to the guacamole
It was very tasty but quite spicy.
I added carrots and cabbage to extend it- worked well!
Very tasty.
Delicious! Simple but lovely.
Lettuce arrived frozen.....not edible
"I had to improvise with tinfoil. I used my own low-calorie dressing, don't like sugar on my veg. I didn't realize we keep the first bowel for the salad to mix in (washed it). I loved it though!"
Have not tried it yet
"Horrible! This is the first meal I’ve gotten from Chefs Plate that I did not like, let alone detested"
The flavor was great but i would have preferred sliced beef
"Nice surprise! Way better than what we were expecting,"
WAY too much peanut butter.
"Steak was mostly inedible, found the salad dressing salty."
Tasty!
"the garlic yogurt wasn’t so great, homemade tzaziki would have been better"
"Filling. Good flavour, fresh veggies, corn tortillas were not the best in texture"
"The vegetables where not fresh, chicken potatoes tasty."
The taquitos were delicious but the cabbage slaw was pretty bland.
didn't care for the sauce
Suggested cooking time for the sweet potatoes was way off. Much more time required.
Good. Vegetables very tasty. Meatloaf could have used a binding agent such as an egg
Sauce was too spicy and the dish didn’t feel like a complete meal
"This was the simplest, best one. Some of the parts of the steak were very gristle, but I'm a meat and potatoes guy. Favorite"
"this was great, my only recommendation would be a tiny bit more of the cheese, the other flavours overpowered it almost completely."
Loved it!
Better on the second day
always the best dough!
Could have more flavour
i was amazed at how smooth this was and how nicely it cane together. I am glad i tried this one
good flavour
Wonton crisps were not tasty at all
missing ingredient: milk
"to garlicky for me, but if would orde again and adjust."
Delicious... would suggest a bit less spinach and a bit more dough.
the best! husband loved it!
Very good. Advised not to use Chili's and was amazing
The meat was not butchered properly and the potatoes had a weird taste.
the pasta in the picture is not what i got sent
Very few carrots were provided. One of the beets was mouldy.
"Super easy, simple and very tasty - but thankfully I was alone since I easily ate both servings on my own. Might want to review the portion sizes for 2 servings."
I always love your burger recipes
Very easy to make and turned out delicious.
Spicy and delicious! Huge portions
"pretty good, kids liked it too"
Would love to get this again
0 stars as my wife got salmonella.
"the whole lime made the dish unexpectedly a bit sour, but was still good."
not enough chicken was provided for this amount
kid friendly
Un peu trop piquant.
I loved this one - and had the second half a day later - still great as long as you keep the tortilla chips separate for reheating.
the dinner was better than the salad
Loved the sumac roast potatoes. Would have given a 5 star for this meal if the chicken was breast rather than thigh. I find the dark meat gross on its own.
Delicious! I’ll do that again.
"food tasted great but the cucumber had gone bad and 1 1/2 of the potatoes were also bad. thankfully I had mini cucumbers at home so I used 2 of my own and even tho I had to throw out some of the potatoes there was still enough for the meal. Overall, not terribly impressed."
meatloaf was a bit bland
Disappointed the pasta was not fresh
A bit spicy! We liked it.
tasty
I feel there was too much sauce but otherwise this was a fabulous meal!
There were barely any veggies compared to the amount of noodles. I followed the directions for cooking the noodles for the shorter amount of time given and they were mush. My carrot was limp.
"Huge calzones, but the bottoms burnt to my pan before the dough cooked through."
Horrible. This was one of the worst chefs plates Ive received. It wasn't flavourful at all. Disappointed!
"They were hard to eat, not the best fish selection either"
"Pasta was not fresh, but non-perishable, which is a sub-par product. Otherwise, flavours were a great idea."
Super good!! Pad Thai is always yummy
small portion
"Like the inclusion of a side salad, as a lot of the meals could use more greens! Also the fig jam dressing was very good."
Different noddles delivered than shown. Missing something.
"i was a bit surprised that Chef's Plate didn't provide a more traditional Pad Thai, ie. without using peanut butter in the sauce. The flavor was good but the peanut butter made for a heavy sauce"
"I sent an email regarding this menu. as disappointed I was with the serving size, it was really good ."
Delicious meal! The instructions about using a paper towel to dry the chicken didn't work as the chicken was quite wet and caused a fair bit of chicken to be lost because it stuck to the paper towel.
The kale really deracted from the great pork chops and nice sweet potatoes.
"yummy food, but very small portion size. Would like to know what are in the seasoning mixes so I can recreate the recipes."
This was excellent.
Kids didn't like bake format. Want to eat with their hands
"very disappointed.. the potatoes had streaks of brown right through them....the mini cucumber ( not enough for 2 people) was frozen , could not eat potatoes or cucumber, NEED 3rd meal to ok or cancell"
"good, but a little spicy for me"
"Not bad, flavour was lacking"
"Delicious. If a recipe needs that much milk it should be provided, but it was great."
really liked the cucumber/tomato salad dressing
It would be good to know what temperature the calzones should be baked at.
Delicious!
Really enjoyed this one. The pesto vinaigrette on the veggies was quite strong but over all a great meal.
Needed more spice/ flavouring
Tasteless! There were so anything that could have been done with those ingredients. Very disappointing!
It wasn't that bad at all. The sweet potato & the carrots were rotten. We receive only 2 ciabattas instead of 4 .
Was okay. one of our peppers was rotten
Haven’t been able to try. Delivered a week ago and the avocado is still not ripe.
easy to cook. fresh tasting pasta with fresh mushrooms and kale and leeks.
Very tasty. Enjoyed this.
Tasty!
"The best!!! Spice, flavor and meal Was delightful."
Tasty and not too spicy - I added extra fresh chilis - personal preference
My fav!!!
This was a nice Chow Mein loved the Bok Chou and the lime sauce although for my personal taste I only used half the lime :)
more marinara sauce would be awesome! it was too strong the balsamic taste
needs more veggies
the cut of meat was disappointing. there was grisle and chunks of fat that couldn't be eaten.
Yum. Recipe card says to preserve some of the cider vinegar but never tells you what to do with it??
Sauces were incredible!
Delicious
Loved this meal!!!
Would have been better with hamburger instead of the beans.
Not enough veggies for the amount of noodles
Portions too small
"Gnocchi should not be in the water more than 1 or 1 1/2 mins, as they will continue to cook with the sauce after... Everything was mushy."
Pretty plain...was just ok
"The slaw was a surprise, very good, so simple. Baking the taquitos really changed the ingredients."
Ingredient was missing from our bag. Impossible to tell what the meal would have been like if the lime had been included as intended.
Absolutely perfect!
One of the better chefs plate meals. Would be nice if the tortillas weren’t so dry.
Very tasty with just the right amount of heat.
Very rich but good
too salty
Can you rate the spiciness of the menus - I do not like a lot of heat - so I would have used less of the spice
Chicken were small portions.
Very small portions. Not a great recipe overall.
flavours were very good but the chicken portions were small. Barely feed my husband and I. The potato’s and cucumber were old and were not usable.
Enjoyed very much

I did not eat because of recall
"Cucumber was soggy, so had to run to store to replace. Salad was a little underwhelming and calzones were huge and a bit doughy."
"the pad thai sauce wasn't good and really thick, surprised fish sauce was not included as that's pretty standard for pad thai; also, the rice noodles stick together in one big clump"
It would have been better if my cucumber wasn't bad. I had to throw it away because it was so soft and squishy.
Was really good except we don't care for kale. would appreciate being able to substitute spinach
"the fish was mushy even after cooking for 30mins and flipped twice and on bottom rack feared that it was still not cooked properly so it went into the garbage the salad had rotten, slimy leaves in the bag; the fries were not crispy even after cooking for 45mins. will be canceling my subscription after this wasted my day and left me haungry and with no supper"
Yum!!
Do over
beef was a bit bland. potatoes and basil pesto sauce were great!
delicious! would definitely order again
too many potatoes
"Way too much peanut butter, not enough balance and spices in sauce. Was literally like we were eating noodles in a bowl of peanut butter."
"cabbage was a bit off so we skipped that, but the rest was great!!"
this would be great with less noodles but add tofu
"Tasted great, but very small quantity."
Needed a bit more sauce...
So yummy! Loved it :)
"Really nice, we added some veggies to the burger"
not enough flavour or seasoning. very bland.
Did not like too hot and not really just spicy.too much cabbage and not enough rice
"There was a recall on one of the ingredients, which was dissapointing"
"Tasty, but more of a burger without a bun than a meatloaf!"
perfect amount of spice!
"This was very tasty, spices were just right with this dish."
The halloumi cheese was better then I expected! What a terrific meal!
excellent flavours
Very good
love recipes with tons of flavor like this!
The calzone was great but the cucumber was frozen in the bag and had to be thrown out.
This was phenomenal..!! I have always want to cook good vegetarian meals.....your dishes involving tahini are superb...really look forward to them..we now have meatless Mondays..thank you
I didn’t add the sugar and glad I didn’t . the tomatoes are plenty sweet. this recipe needs feta though!
wasn't in box :(
Excellent !
This was quite delicious. The fish was a bit difficult as it wasn't totally breaded but the seasoning was good.
The marinara was too salty. A very simple dinner that would have cost my a fraction of what I paid through chefs plate of I had bought it all myself.
wasnt super fond of this one
"Far too many noodles, not enough veggies"
The produce was old.
Tastes great but fish fell apart.
missing soy sauce :(
Delicious but the chicken was really fatty
"Excellent taste! The fish was very crispy. The fries were a little soft but delicious. I LOVED the salad. The one thing I will say is eat this right out of the oven, and if you have leftovers, reheat them in the oven as well. I got distracted between cooking and eating and it doesn't taste nearly as good cold."
The pre-prepped potatoes made everything super easy
The garlic kale was very good but the sweet potato was crunchy and not soft.
We loved the spice mix!
SOOOOOOOO Good!
Simple but good.
"very dry, needed more sauce."
"This was tasty, but the portion (especially the portion of Halloumi) seemed much smaller than the usual portions in the bag. Was left hungry."
should of had a healthy side like a salad
Tasted great but was messy to get out of serving dish and tortillas curled up on top layer.
salad was pretty boring but had a good vinegarette. Wasnt able to try the fish seasoning because it was missing. yam fries eere okay but are soggy unless deep fried
Perhaps strips of mango to go in the tacos?!
loved that it was so easy to prepare and yet so tasty!
bland
Too hot.
amazing
would of likes chicken breast not thigh. teast was good.
Was good to eat. Not a favorite meal made from you though.
I can't believe I made this! It was so good! My BF said it was better than the one from Freshii!
"I received two of the smallest carrots to make this dish! it was supposed to be 12 oz worth and when I weighed it, the carrots were only 3oz. I had to supplement my own carrots. whoops."
would have liked a bit more spice in this one
not sure how this was as my box never arrived!
Pretty good! Potatoes turned out a bit bland.
sides were good but was disappointed with the fish. it was so slimy we even cooked it longuet and was still gross :(
Very acidic with vinegar in both of the pasta and salad dressing
Really good.
Yum!
Veggies were lacking
The cucumber was bad in this bag too. The calzone was great however.
Really good but would be better with chicken
This was really a noodle dish. The carrot had been frozen and was un edible. The bock Choy cooked down to nothing so left with noodles and 1/2 a pepper for supper ??
Delicious!
Yummy
"Really good, not enough mayo for both dishes though"
Very flavourful and delicious!
amazing! delicious!!!
Tasty
Not bad. Better without the mayo.
"Artichoke liquid makes it impossible to construct - leaky, slimy and weird."








love it! But would of loved more vegetables
Delicious but added goat cheese to the salad
great!
yummy and simple!!!
lack of souvlaki flavoring and veggie serving size too small
"roasted sweet potatoes were not cooked, kale was bitter and had stems included in the mix. very disappointing taste - no flavour and ingredients were not worth the money. pork was delicious but we threw away everything else."
so easy so good!! the salad vinaigrette could be very addicting
this recipe was too much work for something that was just so so
"Unfortunately, this was really gross. I couldn't eat it at all. It has so much peanut butter that it just tasted like noodles with peanut butter. It made me wonder if I was sent the right amount of pb"
the vegetables had come rotten! Made it 2 days after arriving. Too much balsamic.
"easy, fast and great flavours"
Delicious but cucumber was not fresh
Simple to make and tasty with the chutney
Steak was tasty but a lot of fat and grizzle.
Kids liked this one especially the green beams
Delicious and simple to make! A bit skimpy on the amount of veggies. Plus my cucumber had gone bad so I had to omit. I used the tomatoes and vinaigrette over salad instead and turned out fantastic!
The dressing for the salad is simple yet delicious.
This was really gross. The marinara sauce doesn’t work.
tossed the chicken as it was rancid smelling so never tried
"steak cut even though listed as rib eye was tough, disappointing for sure"
The sauce was too vinegary even after boiling the vinegar down.
"flavor ok but not great. recipe needed some correction, too much water in beans, should have used less of bean liquid, baked for 10 mins but not hot enough, could have been 15+ minutes"
"The recipe was very tasty but although portions are normally amazing, this one was small and the cucumber for the salad was shriveled"
Cucumber didn't stay very fresh. 3 days in it was unusable
Very tasty! I wish it had a protein though.
Disgusting
Very nice flavor...simple to prepare.
The fish doesn't cook too well and was quite slimy inside and we even cooked it longer than suggested. The rest of the dish was delicious.
the meatloaf required onions and/or some sort of gravy
Slaw was tasteless.
very peanut buttery
The slaw was not good. Jerk chicken was delicious. Had to add cheese and onions.
the fish was very mushy and not flaky so I'm not sure if 450 was too high a temp to cook at or the fact that the fish was still a bit frozen
We’ve noticed we often get little bottles of white vinegar with our meals. Maybe people could be encouraged to have vinegar on hand in bulk (like with oil) so we can avoid waste?
DELISH!
Needed some sauce for the meatloaf
SO GOOD!!!
"l love Pad Thai so perhaps my expectations were a bit high, but these just tasted like Peanut Butter and Noodles :("
The syrup glaze was runny and the potatoes were not cooked
I cooked the gnocchi for the time you said and they were WAY over cooked
"Very ordinary, meh meatloaf, but the veggies were good."
Outstanding meal
"Nothing crispy about this- it all came out soggy, but still tasted good."
Was not crazy about this one.
this is one of my favourites !
wonderful!
Litttle plain. Would have been better if more cheese was layered throughout
Could use the occasional fish recipe.
bland and a bit too complicated for what you got
Enjoyed the seasoning in the sausage
Good
The piece of chicken was rather small
"The fish was not great, followed directions and the fries were burnt"
Kinda blah meatloaf veggies were great
3 of our four bags were incorrect this past week. We received the Pad Thai bag instead of the meatloaf bag. Two other recipes were missing ingredients. I called and they gave us a credit.
"okay if you dont know what pad thai taste like, this dish seemed poorly constructed and the flavor was off"
The cucumber was rotten!
The tomato and pepper were rotten!
sweet corn was weird but the spicy jerk chicken tacos were delicous.
Way too many onions.
LOVE IT!
The kale was not well received by anyone. Too many stems - bitter. Not a lot of flavour
Great flavour combos and came together super quick. My rice vinegar had leaked out so the plain cabbage slaw wasnt great.
meatloaf was too small but had good flavour otherwise
Delicious
So underwhelming!!! The quality of Chef’s plate is gone!
Yummy and easy to make
Ok- quite mushy
Simple and delicious.
too much fat on the chicken
Both my picky-eater toddlers loved these bowls!
Peanut butter sauce was very sticky
Not very tasty
Vegetables were rotten.
rotten veggies again....1 carrot and 1 potato had to be thrown out. Recipe was just ok. not something I would order again
Yum!
Good but a lit of fat on chicken
"didn't use the rapini because I don't like it, but the meal was killer without it!"
"Was good! We had to put back in the oven though as it was still pink, but probably our fault with timing"
"Mmmmmmmm!! Although sweet potato fries, not our fave"
Way more delicious than it looks!
We didn't get the right bag. We received jerk chicken taco ingredients except the meat was pork.
Good flavour in the chicken but coleslaw needs more
Not my favourite recipe. Not Flavorful
"One tiny cucumber, which was past its best. Disappointed"
Garlic kale is a bit too much to ask of kids — probably not a “family” recipe.
Portion seemed smaller than other meals
Pretty good. Beef had too much grizzle in it.
The flavours were weird. It was too spicy and I didn’t like the chunks of artichoke hearts.
The flavours were quite bland. The peanut butter overpowered everything. The rice noodles cooled off quickly so the dish got cold fast.
Pesto vinaigrette was awesome
"Cucumber not useable, soft."
"I don't think this recipe scaled well. The result was a lot of noodles that didn't have enough sauce, and the sauce was overwhelmingly just peanut butter."
Fish wasn't very good at all.
"their wasn’t even chicken for two people to eat - maybe 5 oz of chicken in total which is not enough, especially considering we are paying $9 a plate. also disappointed that the sugar wasn’t included when it used to be"
ingredients had leaked in the bag
Really really good. Took longer than 15 but no complaints. Very good tasting
Needed more cheese
Absolutely delicious!
"could have used a slightly larver portion of chicken on this one, but flavours were very good."
It was too peanuty. It was very overwhelming
Did not really enjoy any of this meal
less peanut butter would be better it ended up too creamy
Good flavour but the brussel sprouts were browning in the bag. Maybe send them whole.
The slaw needed a splash of vinegar
"The recipe did not indicate what temperature to heat the oven to when baking the enchilada. Also, all the tortillas had a tear in them before even taking them out of the bag."
A little too much Balsamic Vinegrette-y taste
We added chicken breasts to add some more protein. Delicious !
"You sent me the pork and the recipe, but the grocery bag for the spicy jerk chicken tacos"
"Fish didn't really get crispy, despite being thoroughly dried first and cooked beyond the suggested time"
"There was definitely something ""missing"", I think it was acid or peppers. I think it needs more spice."

Pork isn't great in the frying pan.
Pork chops were dry
As previously mentioned to the produce had been frozen. Therefore not rating.
Missing curry paste !!!!
Tartar sauce yummmy. Great fish freshness.
Delicious! But more veggies would be nice.
Produce was bad (cucumber and tomatoes) when we went to make this today (Sunday) and the cut of meat was horrible - have picture if you want.
slaw needed more flavours than just lime
this was SO GOOD
Yummy but hope you like garlic!
Got the Wrong recipe cards
"The kale was bitter, the sweet potato dish was flavourless, and the pork was flavourless as well. I bought this for a dinner party, and couldn't even serve the Kale, and everything else was poor."
"Sweet potatoes were hard, not cooked in 15 minutes"
the glaze didn't really work
"Flavourful without excessive heat, a nice option, my family enjoyed it."
Didn’t receive the Greek seasoning packet but everything else was good
Great coleslaw! That should be a side for other sandwiches and things. The beef and rice were okay. Ground meat and rice kind of feel too similar in texture.
"Potatos were already doting brown (day after delivery), only one 10cm cucumber was included (unedible as it was alreafy wayy past its good days)."

"Absolutely delicious, it hit every flavour note, completely balanced and the addition of the thai chilly, finished it perfectly :)"
"Good recipe, easy and tasty. No reason to have precooked rice though .."
Great flavour
Impossible to cook
disappointing. could use some protein and more veggies. left with way too many noodles
Super yummy. Just wish my cucumber was in a bit better shape when it arrive. Already was shrivel shriveling on the one end
Not enough veggies. Just starchy veggies like potatoes and carrots
Absolutely delicious and so easy!
Everyone loved this dish
Great flavour
loved the recipe but our chicken was leaking when we received
very bland. needed a ton of hot sauce just to add some sort of flavour... could have used about twice the amount of cheese too...
Tasty combination. Meat was a bit dry; otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.
Easy to make the breaded chicken and liked having 4 meals out of one food prep session.
"maybe could have been one more carrot, but flavour was really good!"
it was pretty bland and not very much cheese for something with “cheesy” in the title. I added lots more cheese.
liked everything about this dish!
loved the salad (dressing was delicious!)
Excellent
"It wasn’t bad, but the balance of flavours was off. The peanut butter was very overpowering (I only used about 2/3 of the amount it said to use)."
Pretty plain and too much vinegar in tomato sauce
The meatloaf was portioned too smsll for a family of four but the recipe is great
Children did not enjoy. Could use snow peas or more veggies.
not enough veggies - 1 small cucumber & tomatoes need stiffer packaging to not get smooshed
This one was not worth the extra $6... the meat was very fatty and the vegetables were not fresh... so to be safe I threw them into the stirfry to cook them.
Beef quality is no good... it was very fatty and adding the pesto sauce made the entire thing super greasy
Was not easy to cook. Honestly should have been rated as hard.
"very tasty, but not filling enough"
"Great idea, however it lacked flavor. I also felt like it could have used different filling."
the sauce could be a little more authentic using fish sauce and tamarind paste
this was my first vegetarian recipe on chefs plate and it went great! i thought for sure i had messed up the crusts but they ended up being pretty forgiving
average - nothing spectacular
"loved it, can’t wait for lunch tomorrow"
I must admit I was disappointed to find the pasta wasn't the fresh pasta that we have come to really appreciate in our previous chefs plate orders. We also prefer using cream instead of milk.
Loved these calzones! Needed to have some patience with stretching out the dough - ended up using a rolling pin to roll it out.
"I enjoyed this, even though I hate leafy greens. It takes a bit more multitasking in the kitchen, though."
Lacking flavour
Cucumber was rotting
"Set off the smoke alarm, too much oil on the pan"
boring but easy to make
meatloaf was quite dry
"Would have been perfect if there had just been more of a ""crunch."" We added sun chips to it."
This was awful
"4 stars for the calzones alone. The salad however was lacking flavour and dressing, we had to substitute our own. Also our didn’t come with the cucumbers."
too much vinegar in both...too dstrong of flavour
The gnocchi was pasty and not good
very tasty meatloaf and vegetables
just enough spice! We did not use the mayo at all. Keeps calories down.
less onion and cabbage
"Flavour profile was great but I had to supplement with my own veggies because I received 2 small, wilted carrots for the veggie portion of this recipe."
"The recipe was good, but the quality of the food - meat and produce is declining. Please include pantry items in the ingredients again."
perfect amount of kick:)
This was easy and tasty!
The cucumber was no longer fresh by Thursday (we receive the meals on Monday) so we were not able to use it.
Nice flavour but the noodles were a mushy clump even though I cook them for the minimum time.
This recipe was amazing!!!
no stars really for this dish. Something was wrong with the fish we got and we couldn't eat it.
There was too much balsamic taste
Finally a meatloaf I like! :)
so delicious and super easy to make
"This was a very disappointing recipe. There was no flavor and the shells tasted like they were stale. We are not typically disappointed with Chef Plate recipes, however, this meal was not good."
"Was good, my son really enjoyed making and the taste of the meatballs."
I personally didn't mind it but both my boyfriend and stepson would not eat it. It also looks nothing like the photo.
Too much peanut butter
it was rather dry - needed to add an oil to eat this
Amaze-balls!
So delicious and so filling!
Could get the dough to stay stretched out.
A definite favourite!!! Absolutely blew my expectations out of the water!! Amazing!
Very good. Loved the fig dressing for the salad. Large portions
100% would get this again
This was not even edible. The fish had gone bad or something. We had to through it out and cook something else.
delicious
Good but went to eat on Saturday (Delivery on Tuesday) and the salad was bad :(
Spicy yet it did not say on the recipe card that it was.

could use more flavour
Could have been a bigger helping. Not enough for two really.
What a mess! Didnt have the Pad Thai flavors at all. Turned out very messy. Like just a pile of noodles and vegetables.
Not my favorite
I made the yogurt garlic sauce into a tzatziki instead but the rest was amazing
"Good flavour, but nothing overly exciting!"
Not bad. Needed a bit more flavour so added onion and chopped tomatoes with basil
"Not very good, needed a protein even tofu would’ve been fine, and says to boil the noodles for 5 to 7 minutes which was way too long and the noodles were mush"
"They were a little bland, we added our own sauce"
"very flavourful. when the mayonnaise, beef and coleslaw are combined in a bite it’s delicous."
The meat was rather plain and there wasn't enough veggies
The pork was the only thing we enjoyed
"These were pretty yummy, easy to make, fast, we forgot the jerk sauce though. Kids seemed to like it."
"The sauce was tasty, the potatoes were good, the kids ate them. Meatballs were bland though."
Don’t keep milk and noodle weren’t fresh
the meat was a bit greasy but it was still great
I added chicken - so awesome!
So great! And quick!
quite bland
too much peanut butter
"A pris plus de temps de cuisson qu'indiqué, mais très bon!"
Could have used a little more spice or flavour.
Did not care for the fish it was wet. did not cook up well
The pesto vinaigrette was awesome!
Sadly the carrots we got were rotten
Wish there would be some repeats on the recipes as we'd like to have some of them more often
Fish was soggy after being baked for over 30 mins
We found the chicken not well prepared - too much fat left on the meat.
"Good flavours, a bit spicier than I was expecting"
This is my ultimate favourite!
Loved the orzo and the tenders
Was ok. Not the same as the picture tough
"So easy, my 8 year old cooked it! loved by us all"
Huge hit!
Loved the salad dressing for this meal. Did not care too much for the fries and the fish seasoning was okay.
"it was good, would have preferred zucchini."
the wraps were especially delicious
this one was disappointing.
Was not flavoured very well
"The slaw was a little bland, I added some lime rind to perk it up"
This one could become a staple...and I see opportunity for a few tweaks and additions. cherry tomatoes; garlic focaccia and a Rich & Robust by Jackson Triggs ;)
needs more spice
"Hmm, just so so. The salad was good"
"Tasty, but not very much food for my husband and myself"
"Very generous size, could have made 3 instead of 2!"
alot of fat on the chicken pieces. White wine vinegar leaked but still had enough for recipe.
Bland with not enough flavour
"sweet potato were hard, and undercooked even when i cooked them longer than the recipe recommended."
The water measurements were totally off made for bean soup that we had to drain. Finding the water measurements with most a little off
Fish and fries were great. Not super sure of the tartar sauce. Overall though really good.
was ok.. kids didnt like it as much as the other meals
quick and easy..
"not a fan of the ginger rice, ate without the rice and it was delicious"
easy to make and delicious
"Not great and I wish it had protein, if just tofu would be fine"
Probably the best meal we have had at chefs plate!
Needs a protein. Very good but not filling
Delicious and easy.
Pretty tasty and great portion size.
The chicken was very fatty and the garlic was very overripe.
Would have liked s little bit of spice and adding a protein like protein would have been ideal - I find most vegetarian meals offered lack protein and I’m hungry again later in the evening :(
the meat was tasteless
Very tasty
Bland
This was the best of the 3 meals. So good!
So good! Added noodles and pork to make for 5. Worked great
"Good, but I found it very peanut buttery. It was better the next day"
The cider vinegar pack leaked again. Second week in a row... Might be a quality issue with the packaging!
Whole meal tasted too vinegar-y. Gnocchi very doughy.
Loved it all
Not really enough chicken for 2 people. We'd prefer chicken breast to chicken thighs. Don't fill up half the plate with potatoes.
Vegetables were the best part!
Sauce was tasty but too thick
My sons loved this!
very good just took a lot longer to cook then the 25 monutes
Potato wedges were “meh” would have preferred a salad for nutritional variation
Good meal and portion size. Would have been even better with a protein added to it.
Excellent! Best meal we tried yet.
Really well balanced dish. Great with fresh cracked pepper on top.
"Would have enjoyed cotijla over sour cream, but enjoyed the heat."
Terrible recipe! The fish did not cook properly and the sweet potato fries burnt! Total waste of money as we could not eat anything!
"Very good. The cucumber and tomatoes came a bit on the frozen side, made the salad a bit less appealing. But we had a pretty good cold snap, I expect this won’t be an issue often."
"Tomatoes and cucumbers were soft, mushy. Would have been4 stars if they hadn’t been over ripe"
"Less flavourful than expected, over all good."
Not enough cheese
Butterflied is a bit trickier to cook (doesn't sit flat) and takes up more pan space.
Awesome
this was also fun to make - creating the layers & baking it. Delicious. I appreciate the variety of your meals.
I would love this with phyllo or a flaky pastry instead of pizza dough. The dough is pretty heavy.
Really interesting blend of flavors.
"Two types of cheese, Ricotta and Parm, the warm was not included. Two weeks in a row with forgotten ingredients."
one of my favorites so far. pesto added to baked carrots and potatoes is a nice way to do a side!
Yummy and super easy to prepare.
"Didn’t care for the coleslaw but liked the chicken. Again, meat portion is small."
Super delicios and easy! Huge portions.

"Too much peanut butter, would be better with shrimp or chicken"
This was a little too sweet for me.
Restaurant quality.
Delicious and easy to make
So delicious!
Portion size too small
"The potatoes were good. The cucumber was mushy and couldn’t use it! The chicken didn’t really taste like chicken souvlaki. Also, the portion wasn’t enough for two people"
Loveds the Gnocchi. But would have loved a little more brussel sprouts in the salad mix.
Fantadtic
"Good, added some of the leftover Kale from the other dish since we had so much leftover."
"Everything was tasty , however the tomato and cucumber salad was very small for two people."
The beef was a bit bland - I would have preferred more spice when it was cooking as opposed to in the sauce to add (mayo)
amazing!!!
Okay...
Made it into hamburgers.
Not very good quality ingredients
Very good salad a bit small
"delicious but needed protein so i added chicken, also needed heat so added siracha"
yummy and easy to recreate. Filling and tssty
LOTS of noodles but not as many vegetables to put into it! Seemed a bit disproportionate
Garlic kale was a little lacklustre
croutons became soggy in seconds and half mashed sweet potatoes were not appealing
I loved this one! I can't wait to make it again.
The kale wasn’t very good. Sweet potato cooking instructions weren’t accurate to achieve well-cooked potatoes.
"Tasty, though my cucumber was rotten so had to toss it."
"Great meal, the favourite."
Tasty
the meatloaf wasn't really a meatloaf ..
We added chicken. But we will certainly make this again and again.
J'aurais mis plus de légumes et un peu plus de noix
The thighs were tough and the cucumbers and tomatoes weren't fresh
The arugula was half bad and there was too much vinegar in both parts of the meal
amazing flavours and amazingly easy to make!!
Did not get time to make it. Wasted meal unfortunately.
"Really good, but more of an Italian meatloaf than a classic meatloaf. I boiled the potatoes before baking."
Tasty. A little complicated. Lemon dressing was a little sour for my taste.
Not enough taste not enough cheese
"Cucumber was not the freshest, could have had larger salad portion, less potatoes"
"There was two much kale for two people, we didn't use it all. Enjoyed the pork and the cider glaze"
First time trying Pad Thai and we will order again !!
"somewhere between packaging and drop off my fresh food got frozen, very disappointed, been ordering for years. One order my produce was not as fresh as it could be it had a worm sticking out of it"
It was very good. Not enough of the lovely sauce and veggies for the amount of noodes.
"great size, very filling and excellent flavor"
the chicken wasn’t very good quality
"this lacked flavour, more spices needed"
The ingredients were interesting and instructions were easy to follow but I thought the peanut butter was overpowering
"Awful. Had 2 packs of rice vinegar in our package so I used both and it was so overpowering. The rice was also not steamed enough, the package it was in was rock hard and was hard to break apart."
"The togarashi spice packet was already opened so we obviously threw it out without using it, not wanting to take our chances with it being contaminated."
Tasty but hard to serve. Needed to add cheese as we felt there wasn’t enough included.
small portions
The salad dressing was a little too sweet
would have liked a bit more sauce for the amount of pasta
I added chicken and siracha and more garlic
fish mushy fries not crisp 2 ingredients included garlic that wasn’t specified had to call
Not a big enough meal
Not very good at all. Could have made it for a fraction of the cost. Basically just peanut butter and noodles. At least add more soy sauce and some chicken.
"Good, but our carrot was rotting. I subbed it out."
Delicious!! And fast!
This recipe was SOO good! My family loved it.
Quite good
"doesn't help if you don't have the right size casserole, but good nonetheless. I would rate it more 2.5 stars. I enjoyed the meal, kids did not."
Amazing taste and extremely satisfying!
bland and the gravy was disgusting
"Flavour is very tasty, rich but not heavy. The lime adds perfect acidity to finish the dish."
Absolutely delicious!!
One of our favourites.
Flavour was good for what ingredients weren't spoiled.
I added avocados. Yummy. Thanks for letting us know how to cut down on the heat. Very helpful

"This all tasted very good, but it took much much longer for the fish to cook than the recipe indicated. After 25 minutes in the over we had to finish off on top of the stove to get it to crisp up."
could have used more carrots - only had two tiny carrots
This was ok. There was lots to eat and was tasty.
First time I have ever been asked to supply my own milk. Definitely dont have milk in my fridge and had already started making the recipe
a little tricky flipping the sanwich in the pan but lots of flavour in the end
The rapini was a little too bitter for our tastes. I would try a different green next time.
This was fantastic!
salad dressing was amazing so where the sweet potato fries although the fish was not the best baked
shouldn’t have peanut butter for the sauce
Kids didnt like the pesto sauce on the veggies but the adults loved it.
I did not order these.
"Pretty good, but the salad was a little plain"
"We liked the flavours in this one. But the carrot matchsticks were rotten in the bag, and we cooked it only a day and a half after receiving our box."
tasted great
"A little bland. Had to add hot sauce, salsa to kick it up."
"Flavour was good but baking time was too short, the inside was cold."
The sub buns fell apart from the sauce and the meatballs could have used more flavour.
Family loves this and there was plenty for 5-6 people.
Needed something more to it. Ended up adding cucumber. Was a bit boring.
e-coli warning didn't eat
too spicy (opps). but coleslaw needed something else to it.
Was delicious with great flavor akd huge portions for two people!
"Quick, easy, tasted great!"
Steak was very fatty. Could only eat about a quarter of it
Sides weren’t fresh
Excellent but could use Chicken
One of the yellow peppers had gone bad. We had this dish three days after it arrived in the mail. I added chicken and hot peppers to give it a little more flavor and substance. Overall pretty good.
"Very filling and delicious. Only two sandwiches + lettuce, so not a ton of food"
pretty good flavor and portion was pretty good.
Too much corn and lime slaw. Not enough other ingredients. Unimaginative.
We loved it
This was amazing
Tasty.
Excellent!
"Delicious and perfectly spicy, use less jerk sauce if you prefer less spicy."
Was good but not enough chicken for 2 people.
Veggies are not great quality. Used some had is fridge. Good reciepe.
very tasty
not good very little flavor meat had the consistency of dog food needed more vegetables and texture the worst meal we’ve had with chefs plate
needed more flavour / cook times/ temps were off. better instruction on suggested pan sizes and construction would have helped
one of the best dishes we have had!
Sooo tasty! Portion size was small
"Loved, loved, loved the Salad!"
"Not sure I'd call it a soup as u can eat it with a fork, but was very tasty"
super tasty! Both the cucumber and the tomatoes were mushy. Luckily I had some of my own to use in the recipe.
so good! delicious!
Followed directions exactly - Quinoa was a solid clump - almost like they only sent enough for 2 portions and not 4. Meat had a funny taste to it
The seasonings for the meatballs was not in the bag.
"This was sooooo light, it needed something else to round out the meal."
super simple tomake but not the tastiest.
"fish was not crispy at all, even though instructions were followed."
really good but was sent a really small onion for 2 servings
Fantastic!
my favourite dish so far
Loved it
the whole meal rocked!!!
Not enough potatoes were provided.
this recipe is flavouful but it would benefit from a better crustier bun than the one provided
delicious
This was unbelievable!!!
"Quick, easy and delicious."
"This recipe was delicious, the potatoes were some of the best I have had so far!"
The fish wasn't that great but the idea of it all was
"Pretty good, could have been a bit more flavourful"
Our cucumber was rotten. We are disappointed that you are providing less chicken now (3 thighs for 2 people instead of 4). This is not the quality of meals that used to be provided.
Was basically rice noodles smeared with peanut butter.
Delicious meal however it required butter that wasn't supplied. So I had to go to the store to buy butter before I made this meal. Kind of defeats the purpose of chefs plate!
Not enough protein!
was looking forward to it for weeks and it did not disappoint!
We added just a bit more cheese :)
cheap meal not worth the money
not so great. we were disappointed with this one. flavours were very bland and there wasnt enough for 2 people to eat and feel satisfied for dinner
Kids didn’t enjoy but the adults did!
easy and delicious
"Enjoyed the paste, not the salad. Several items where missing."
"Not very good, something was off with this recipe ven the colour didn’t look like the picture."
Surprisingly VERY tasty and filling!
gnocchi was very starchy and I received red onions instead of shallots so the taste was off
My profile says 'please no fish'. I don't understand why the system would send me fish and expect me to pay for it. I can't eat fish (can eat seafood though). Had to give this away to someone.

Tasty meal but a little shy on the amount of potatoes and green beans. Seems like your reduced prices also mean reduced quality and quantity. I’m not as in love with you as I used to be.
the Canadian version is better
"The rice and veggies as well as the sauce were good, however the fish had a very odd test (like dirt) even though I cooked it a bit longer than what was recommended. Also the fish had a pretty large bone inside of it. I understand that probably can’t be helped, but probably dangerous had a child been eating it."
We weren't too sure about this but loved it!
I felt like I wanted a little sprinkle of peanuts and it would have been perfect.
"Quite tasty couscous, but needs more sauce."
Cornstarch was missing. Another veggie would have been nice.
not enough chicken!
"I found this pretty good, I feel some potatoes should of been sent . The gravy cooked in to the meatballs so there was no gravy but it was tasty ."

it was my first meal with chefs plate. it was way better than anything I could do on my own
"Flavours and textures were great, especially the oven-cooked broccoli and slightly spicy sauce. Perfect quick dinner: easy, healthy and yummy. My only issue is that I can't cook something like this in 15 minutes."
"rice turned out mushy, would have preferred to cook raw rice"
we didn’t receive black sesame seeds
bag of salad was more than necessary but sandwich was delicious. love the brie.
kind of bland and not great as a meal because it’s not very filling
THIS IS SO GOOD
"Wasn't really a dinner item, it was more like a lunch item"
"so far this was my favourite for the week, nice comfort food with great taste"
My favourite veg recipe I've tried so far! I added red pepper flakes at the end to balance the sweetness.
"La soupe est très goûteuse! Mais il manque de bouillon, il est très vite absorbé par les nouilles et ça devient de la bouette."
too much balsamic vinegar. the baby arugula was a bit wilted when I went to use it
small portion and came out watery
"Did not receive black sesame seeds, only regular so not sure if it would have changed the flavoring."
"All I received in my kit was the meat, cheese and potatoes, nothing else! This is the reason I have asked to stopped deliveries! I don't tolerate incompetents, sorry!"
Definitely going to make this again
Carrot was limp and tiny - needed protein (chicken/tofu) - I added chicken and fish sauce
No tomatos in bag and slimy cucumber could not be used. Skimpy meal but chicken was good.
Really enjoyed the pesto vinaigrette on vegetables.
Too many rice noodles and not saucy enough.
Enjoyed having a vegetarian meal but found it lacked flavour.
loved it!
Delicious once again. Great flavor with adjustable amount of spice
"Great heat, sneaks up on you"
Gross
No idea. It wasn’t shipped to me.
arrived without spices
great recipe
found this to be dry and difficult to eat
"This was excellent meal. Only reason it's not 4 stars. - there was no breading spice seasoning packet in my bag. But I had cornmeal, Panko crumbs and Cajun spice in my cupboard so it worked out great"
not a big enough meal needs more.....
"some additional protein (e.g. chicken, tofu, shrimp) would be good"
Fish was great. Rice was great. The beans were old and tough and stringy. Veggie quality seems to be going down folks.
Very tasty but again way too much for 2 seniors. More than 4 portions.
"I didn’t love the onion spices, but it was tasty overall. I would not make this again."
really enjoyed this one
All the calzones are wonderful for freezing to enjoy later.
Delish!
The potatoes were far too big to only be broiled for ~12 minutes. They needed more like 25 minutes based on how big they were.
One of my favorites.
Bun was very narrow to fit all contents. Would have preferred a square bun.
"the coconut lime spices were missing , but it was still really tasty."
Sloppy Joe tasted great but the potatoes were grey in color. After being cooked they looked like rotten potatoes no one could eat them. Not edible.
Good flavour but super messy. Bread needs to be wider
Disapointment
Super simple and great portion size. Very good overall.
Absolutely LOVE the kale! So flavouful and simple! This fed me three large meals and I loved every one of them.
Less noodles and more vegetables and peanut “sauce” would have improved this meal
onion totally over powered he meal but without it there was a total lak of flavor
Good!!
"The meal was awesome, but couldn’t use the potatoes as they all had spoiled spots all the way through. So had to use our own.??"
"Incredible flavours. Do this one again, please."
"Did not get my food, courier problem they say"
"Beans with the tortillas made it mushy- would have enjoyed it more with ground chicken or turkey, but salsa and sauce were excellent"
needed more of an acid to even out the flavours
"boring, not very flavourful."
loved it. quick and delicious
Very bland
"Rotten cucumber, bruised apple, and stale bread. But a whole plate full of salad. Unsatisfying to say the least."
Our favourite recipe so far! 10/10
Loved the potatoes. Meatballs had a little too much spice and they soaked up all of the gravy. Was still pretty good.
Portion too small
portion sizing was very small and meat was very bland
Very light and enjoyable
LOVED this !
Fish needs to be fresher and dish needs more ingredients - coleslaw dressing needs to be lighter and more tangy (too much mayonnaise)
I preferred not to have the noddles.
"We did not receive the Fish Spice Mix. Had to cook fish longer than recommended, as was still raw."
Where to begin. Disgusting.






Chicken was too thick.
Cucumber was over ripe
Delicious! The salad was a bit disappointing
awesome!!!
Good and very quick to prepare
"Way too much peanut putter. There isn't any authentic Pad Thai sauces like fish, tamarind, etc."
"Too spicy spanakopita mix! There were chilie flakes in it, and no warning that it's spicy!"
veggies tossed in the pesto were delish!!
joy crazy about the salad. chicken tastes goos
Les tomates ont souffert du froid à la livraison
Not that flavourful.
The arugula was slimy and smelled like wet hay I took a photo. . I subbed in baby spinach that was a week older and still better by far your quality control is poor this is the second time in a GE weeks
I preferred when the milk used to be an included ingredient rather than something we have to have on hand.
Very tasty and easy to make.
"The spices in the Spanakopita spice mix tasted great, but were a little too intense for the proportions."
"avocado was all black inside so tossed it, taquitos were ok"
"Loved them! However, we only received 6 tortillas for a 4 person family meal."
Sauce wasnt creamy enough. Adding cheddar caused it to clump vs melt
"The cuts of chicken that came with it had lots of gross pieces, once you cut that out there is not much edible stuff left"
Disappointing. Mushy and bland.
Was okay
DELICIOUS!
Good but not pad thai!
"Better than a restaurant and healthier, great portion size"
best one of the week by far
"tasted like spinach and artichoke dip, yum. a little spicy for some members of the family"
Jerk spice was tasty. Easy and filling!
"Excellent but when cooking with lunch option, separate the ""crispy"" tenders either in a different pan or on elevated rack so that the juices from the non-breaded chicken to not impact the crispiness."
the salad was alright but I didn't like the rest
"This was great! I thought I wouldn't like the rapini, but it wasn't bitter at all, it was lovely!"
can't wait for this one to come up again!
flavour was pretty bland
the chicken and sauce were 10/10. but the cuccumber and tomato had gone bad.
meatloaf and cheese were great!
We dredged the chicken in flour before frying - great addition!
added some feta cheese and olives to the salad and it was fab
I always find the basa soggy in the middke even if i cook for a while. Redt tasted great
Excellent!
"I had a very, very hard time working on the refried beans - they ended up being extremely soggy, which then made the dish soggier than it needed to be."
Disappointed you no longer include everything necessary (milk and butter) in the recipes. Some notice in advance of your drop in quality would have been nice.
cucumber and tomatoes were squashed and old
A little disappointing as there was actually no kimchi.
Not my fave
Excellent
My cucumbers I received were rotten but the rest was good.
needed more sour cream
Really tasty.
Could use more sour cream to help with heat
"Was good but slightly bland, mushrooms would have been nice addition and some Italian spices"
Other providers give cod vs basa fillet. The basa is very thin and not very satisfying
This meal was tasty but I would likely not order it again.
Delicious!
Texture of fish was bad. Threw it out. Salad and fries were ver good though
Quantity over quality with this one. Kale was bitter and sweet potatoes were undercooked (even when following instructions for reheating). The pork was tough and little flavor - sorry!
Absolutely fantastic!
So so delicious!
Produce went bad after two days so couldn’t make the tomato salad
So yummy. Will make again at home
No fresh pasta. Pasta was not same as in photo.
loved the pesto on the veggies!
"The subs were great, but I am getting a bit tired of potato wedges with everything."
Tasty! Would love it more if it was fresh pasta
Noodle sticked together. Not enough sauce. Not enough bok choy
this was better than I expected!
"Pretty boring and not very good, baking time was definitely not long enough, had to microwave as it was barely warm after baking time."
Kind of boring. Easy to make
it was delicious but our bag was missing the carrots
Bland
Easy to make
The peanut sauce was tasty; the dish could have used an additional protein like meat or seafood
"Something in the sauce didn’t taste good. Maybe the balsamic vinegar? I love balsamic vinegar but maybe just not with tomatoe sauce? Either way, I’m not complaining! Love your meals!"
milk is not a staple...disappointed it wasn’t included with the meal
Fantastic! So easy and so delicious
Too salty
Great easy delicious meal. My oven only fits one pan at a time so took longer than necessary
excellent
portion too small.
Delicious and so easy!
Maybe a hardy salad instead of root vegs
Loved this
"Very good , missed the fresh pasta"
Very difficult to make. The dough kept breaking
Very bland and only 2 tiny sweet potatoes....made 5-6 “fries” each
"Portion too small for meat, but flavours were good"
This recipe was our favourite so far. We will definitely make it again though with flour tortillas instead of corn. I did not like the texture.
"Flavourless, would be better with fermented kimchi"
Way too much peanut butter for the sauce
Very good...loved the kale
Meatballs tender and flavorful. Great meat
Loved the meal but can’t continue due to the excessive packaging and waste. Please switch to reusable cooler bags and returnable packaging and we will come back!
Nice meal - we added some guamole and it was great :)
"This meal was excellent. Wasn’t going in with much in the way of expectations, but really delicious!"
the pesto vinagrette was amazing. A nice change to enhance baked veggies.
We are really missing the taste of using fresh pasta vs. dry pasta. Disappointed that Chefs Plate has decided to substitute. Really affects the quality of the pasta meals to use dry pasta.
"For whatever reason, the sauce created a weird texture with the noodles. It almost needs to be a thinner sauce and balance out the peanut flavour. It was a bit too peanut-y."
delicious!
Meat and potatoe portion size was far too small. It could go with less cheese to make a little healthier.
potato were bad
It was okay I have found I am not fond of the 15min meals they always seem to be missing something
I would have liked some cilantro
Pasta heavy on the carbs
Kids found it too spicy but adults loved it! I’d serve this to company it was so good!!
I added chicken. Without I felt it was not enough of anything except noodles.
Cucumbers that you send very rarely last in the fridge. Cooked on Friday and the cucumber was just a soft mess
Balsamic vinegar too overpowering in this dish
Ingredients: tomatoes and cilantro were lumped into the bag with cans of beans and a jar of marinara. Smooshed! Recipe: vague layering details and inaccurate bake times. Very disappointing.
The sweet potatoes were hard and way undercooked.
Way too much onion in the orzo. Chicken was very dry for the wrap the next day - it needed some vinaigrette type sauce. The pita type bread had an odd taste to it.
Very easy to make! Thanks!
I did not get to enjoy as my cucumber and potatoes were both rotten. By the time I got to the grocery store to replace these items my chicken was past the expiry date.
"Would prefer a lower cal option, too much egg noodles."
Some Items were destroyed during delivery.. wasn't able to make dish
"Due to bad weather Fresh Sweet potatoes were frozen when thawed had a bad scent , pork chop was discolored only the I cooked the kale was uneatable"
Really like every thing about this dish. Easy to make and good flavors.
Veggies didn’t a look very good for thisnmeal
"The balsamic marinara was way too vinegar-y; we received 2 bottles of vinegar, and it felt like it should have only included 1. We got red onion instead of shallot, and the salad was way too cheesy."
Pasta type was note as pictured. Rapini wasn't as fresh as I would have liked.
Need stronger flavour in the beef. Rice was disappointing in texture.
Loved the rapini.
The soy sauce leaked all through the bag. And the carrot was was not fresh
Got the wrong recipe cards
"Great, but portion size was small (not enough for dinner)"
"Not enough veg, too much noodle."
needs more cheese
"Needed more vegetables, like a salad"
Underwhelming. Too much cheese not enough spicy flavour. Would have benefited from a child oil.
"Roasted veggies and cheesy meatloaf, what's not to love ! simple and incredible"
The cucumber was over rip and not good enough to use so replaced it and the meal was great
There needs to be other sides besides potatos all the time.
"My Brussels sprouts were missing! And there was too much vinegar flavour. I miss just regular good food, you’re trying to be too exotic for my family"
Not enough veggies. Just a few mushrooms
I love the pasta dishes. This was my favourite.
Great tasting. Could eat it in your hands. Quick to make. Looked almost like the picture.
"Love the breaded chicken for dinner but just spiced for the ""wrap"" I wish it was not a pita as it just broke and made a mess."
Needed more substance.. maybe a rice and bean side or an additional veggie
Great flavours.
Sooo delicious and easy! bring back soon!
"Didn't like gnocchi at all, what a waste of money. Not enough vegetables and not enough taste in this recipe. In general, very disappointed with Chefs Plate's quality of products (missing or spoiled)"
no carrots were provided. noodles clumped together
loved it! it actually made way more that 4 servings
concept was great but mela was quite bland for a “Tex mex” recipe. there should have been more tex mex seasoning (two packs instead of one for 4 meals) and more cheese. bell peppers arrived damaged-cracked
Fatty chicken and small cucumber was supplied.
would be great if sweet potatoes were precut like they were in another recipe..fish was yummy salad very plain
Kale was frozen Huron arrival so couldn’t use it. Had to compost it.
It was good.. but nothing healthy with it
Such a delicious recipe. Will remake!
Amazing!
"This recipe was delicious, and really hit the spot for me, though I will need to buy myself some additional ricotta to go along with it if this comes by again. :-)"
Too much vinegar in the recipe and the gnocchi were really soggy.
the potatoes were hard to cut up
i think maybe i just didn't quite like the particular fish
i haven't made this one yet
Needed more flavour
The pesto was a bit too much (soupy almost) but otherwise it was a great meal.
not good. boring and mush
Easy and tasty but needed a side dish.
Great!
"The fish was great - the salad was lacking dressing and flavour, we found we had to substitute our own."
Not enough chicken
the sweet potatoes were undercooked and need double the time to be remotely ready. Tasty dish tho!
the chicken pieces were real greasy and were awful - salad was delicious and potatoes were good
all very tasty
recipe overpowered by peanut flavour
"excellent fish taste, very fresh with nice simple salad. I do wish the potatoes were pre-cut, but would order this again either way."
chicken was awful and not enough cucumber :(
"Good, could have cheese somewhere other than the top layer. Wasn't very ""cheesy"" as name claims"
"The recipe was good, but the quality of the food - cucumbers and meat is declining. Please include pantry items in the ingredients again."
I had issues with noodles - hard to separate and stir into vegetables
Absolutely delicious!
Very tasty!
"Nice and easy, but the lime was pretty dry so the slaw wasn't very good at all."
Both were delish! So nice to have lunch ready for work
Had to throw out the cucumber and tomatoes- they were both soft and mushy. Potatoes needed an extra 20 minutes to cook
Husband had to run to store mid-cook. We never keep milk as a pantry staple. Hate this new thing.
Missing something... bland.
flavours and textures were really well balanced. nice to have the fresh veggies
"Would have been better with cheese in between the layers, not just on top."
"SOOOO good. The porkchops were lovely, the kale salad was tasty and the pecan sweet potatoes were exactly as expected."
Meatball sub was good but I had a rotten potato that I had to throw out. Quality control should be checked.
Added chicken to my leftovers for another meal!
Great!
"Chicken thighs went bad by day 6, we made this dinner last, salad was not enough, potatoes were not enough and 2 were soft (went bad)"
Loved the recipe but the cucumber seemed really old - ended up eating cucumber we had in the house already instead
Flavours were amazing.
Order did not come with soy sauce




excellent
"This was super bland and gummy. Didn't finish eating it, and threw out the leftovers. :("

The marinara sauce came broken and was all over the place :(
"Loved this pad thai recipe. Very creamy and flavourful. If you like a bit more heat like I do, just throw some chili flakes on it and it's fantastic."
I did not enjoy this dish. Did not like the flavour or the texture. First dish I have not enjoyed from chefs plate
Veggies we're bad when delivered
A little too much balsamic used for pasta sauce
loved the pesto viangrette

"My cucumber was bad, but the potatoes, chicken and sauce were amazing!"
This recipe surprised be with how much I enjoyed it! The flavors all went really well together!
loved it
Too much peanut butter and not enough soy and sweet chilli
Good... but I added sundried tomatoes. I think the dish would have been lacking otherwise
"Didn't love the fish, disliked the texture"
Amazing! My favorite recipe of this week!
Very tasty! Loved it
This was good.
Delicious meal
these were a bit spicy for me.
Tasty easy
Didn’t care for the salad dressing though
could have used some more spice
"good, would order again"
Healthy and delicous. The pork was very tender and juicy and the sides had a lot of flavourful.
"Not very flavourful, the chicken was bad so I had to throw it out, along with the sprouted garlic I received. Not an impressive meal."
delicious taste - i loved this recipe !
the spice mix was quite spicy
Great flavors and easy
This meal was delicious!!
decent
Neither fish nor sweet potatoes were crisp. Vinegar pouch leaked and was almost empty.
The potatoes adn carrots were amazing
The cucumbers and tomatoes were over ripe and inedible. The recipe would be good if the food wasn’t expired.
Loved this.
Fish didn’t get crispy. Soft and not flaky. Disappointed!
Add fresh pear to salad
Needed more mayo
Had no taste
"good recipe, requires milk and didn’t receive any, kinda irritating"
totally loved this!!!!!
"loved it! FYI, received two packages of onions in box."
could have used some kind of sauce for meatloaf
Tasty
missing rice vinegar in box. Had some in my pantry.
Excellent. The pesto vinaigrette on roasted vegetables was delicious.
The pasta was a complete different one than in the picture
these were eaten fast and i was told we must have again..
Absolutely fantastic definitely go get again
"Needs a bit more beef and more veg, less rice"
"Cooking time was much longer for 4 person sized meatloaf, but it was very good!"
Delicious!
Chefs plate has the best ever dough
fun to make
Fantastic!
"3.5 stars. loved the rice packaging and prep. Cabbage quantity was low, flavours were yummy."
Loved it! Lots or texture and flavours.
Not bad!
"The recipe was poorly worded (liquid bean reserve), the baking time was not long enough (the tortillas were still too stiff), and there was not nearly enough flavour out of the one spice packet."
Excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed it! Thank-you
Really amazing sauce!
ok ...somewhat bland..was expecting more flavors
Yes
Meatloaf could have used a bit more flavour
This was aweful. I didn't even eat the second plate.
Flavour was good. Pretty greasy. Not sure if ground beef is the proper meat for this dish.
is there a way to get the noodles to mix in with the other toppings? they were kind of clumped together
"ended up being a bit bland with the sauce and maybe a bit dry, very disappointed that it was not fresh pasta"
it was a bit bland and not cheesy enough
"The fish was bland and the under side was mushy. Thought I followed the instructions exactly, but perhaps not."
Not that tasty - dry.
Tasty and easy to make.

Very Flavourful.

"Even had left overs, this recipe seemed to go very far"
Soooo good
"Absolutely amazing flavor and the chicken was so tender. The slaw was delicious, made my own mayo based dressing though."
Yummy tartar sauce
Small portions. The green pepper was spoiled.
"It was okay. Liked the pesto vinaigrette but I took out the potatoes and substituted peppers, cauliflower and broccoli as we do not want so many carbs & startches in our diet."
"really terrible pad Thai, needed more veg, and tofu, the sauce was awful, it was way too much peanut butter. needed some tomato pasta in the sauce or something to cut the richness of the peanut butter"
I think I am not fond of gnocchi...a bit pasty
Fries were great fish not so much
My cucumber was frozen even though I brought the box inside as soon as it was delivered. The potatoes were full of black spots on the inside
My cucumber was wilted and I could only use half of it. Luckily I had a cucumber in the fridge I could use.
The tomatoes and cucumbers were not so tasty. The cucumber we received I tossed and used one of my own. Tomatoes mushy. But other flavours excellent.
Delicious
Delicious and easy. Great portion sizes.
"Delicious and great portion size. Only minor issue was the sauce was too thick, almost gummy. Easy to fix though"
"Good, but the meat felt rough, almost patty-like. Would benefit from some added veal/breadcrumb for tenderness."
I wish you could provide a better white fish then basa.
Really enjoyed this meal
This was a total miss in our option. Basically tastes like noodles

Neither my fish nor my chips were crisp. Not sure what I did wrong.
it was super tasty! but our veggies were a little rotten so I had to buy fresh to make the meal. but other than that it was super good!
a little bit too spicy for me
Not a big fan of the pesto vinegrette there was too much of it for the vegetables
it was good but there was a lot of fat on chicken and when I trimmed it it took away from the meat
"Had similar recipe last year with fresh (not dried) pasta and creme, included (not milk, not included) so this time the recipe was good but a bit disappointing."
needed a few more mushrooms
"Was just alright, nothing fabulous"
Enjoyed and was essy to prepare....especially liked the salad.
Very bland. Pork had no flavour nor did the Kale. The sweet potato was good.
Meat portion is small.
"This was probably the least favourite I've had. The marinara was so balsamic-heavy it came out brown and curdled looking. Also, the recipe called for sliced red onions but recipe referred to shallots"
I think there could have been a little more sauce.
Huge hit.
"The veggies were so good, and the pesto dressing! The meatloaf was very good, but very greasy, too. There was a pool of fat it was sitting in when I took it out of the oven... I had to drain it off."
Very good
"I did not receive the sweet chilli sauce, but double of the peanut butter. My expectations for pad Thai would include bean sprouts (assuming too perishable?) and green onion."
We loved this recipe
i really love the leftovers and making a new recipe with them
"The flavours in this recipe were amazing!! The crunch of the coleslaw mixed with the chicken and tortillas were on point! If you’re not a fan of spicy, you would definitely need to adjust the level of jerk sauce and seasoning that you use (:"
Was pretty good - just not one of the favourites.
"Great flavour, healthy version of true comfort food!"
Not great :(
Awesome. Loved the flavour.
"Too spicy, didn’t finish it"
Loves the veggie flavouring
"This meal really skimped on the veggies. It came with only 1 carrot and 2 green onions. For 2 adults, that is not enough."
very nice combination of Thai flavours
fish spice too salty
Incredible flavors! Can't wait to order this one again!!
Making the cucumber/tomato mix more of a leafy salad would have been a good touch!
Il me manquait les épices. Déception!
"Tasted okay, but I was missing some key ingredients, so i don't think it was as good as it could have been."
Cucumber was soft & not usable in recipe
It was alright. We didn’t receive the shallot or onion that was supposed to come with the recipe.
Not my favorite
Missing one ingredient.
"portion felt small, but it was delicious!"
my tomato was totally squished and I needed to purchase a new one. I wouldn’t describe it as “cheesy” as it only had a sprinkling top. I wouldn’t describe the beans as creamy bc they weren’t... reminded me of Taco Time. Taco kits are simpler and tastier.
potatoes were rotten
excellent
Excellent supper ..... we might have added a bit more cheese !!

kind of boring
"somewhere between packaging and drop off my fresh food got frozen, very disappointed, been ordering for years. One order my produce was not as fresh as it could be it had a worm sticking out of it"
Really enjoyed this one.
Good seasoning
"so great, I wish I had a second bowl!"
Absolutely hated the sauce.
There was not enough coating for fish and it was not crispy
Very tasty. Loved this one
Really great. I served this meal at a dinner party ( 4 people) and everyone loved it. I would suggest having a yellow bell pepper to sweeten the enchilada.
Tasty
Too much peanut butter
Too much of that spice was overpowering
loved it again it’s disappointing when most recipes have garlic an allergy so can’t experience full recipe
the red pepper provided was moldy on the inside.
Yum. We all enjoyed this one!
Made a lot of leftovers...that no one ate.
Very good
"Disappointed that milk wasn't included in the package. How can you assume that everyone has milk? It used to be included, but I guess this is how you lower prices."
The quality of the produce was very poor. The 2 mini cucumbers were broken and shriveled. The quantity of veg is insufficient for a balanced meal.
Excellent!
tastes delicious! would suggest a slightly bigger portion on these noodle dishes.
Cucumber wasn’t useable but otherwise all good
Needed some acid like limes or something
delicious and flavourful
Absolutely amazing. My husband inhaled it
Tasted great but there were way too many noodles - or not enough veggies and sauce.
Also good
"My bag was missing the spices for the fish, but aside from that it’s a really tasty recipe. I liked the non-fried aspect of the fish and the batter was flavourful. And sweet potato fry’s are always good. This salad was probably my favourite, the fig jam mixed with vinegar is delicious."
Good mixture of tastes!
Meatloaf was good. Pesto veggies okay... Needed 1 more carrot.
Lacked flavour and needed more cheese.
"I was expecting the fish to be crispy but it was not, I didn't want to cook it more as it would have been over cooked"
"Found the sweet potatoes bland. Kale similar. Pork was good but the sauce didn't add much to it, wasn't thick enough."
"It was tasty but my cucumber was frozen. Must be difficult to get the freezer pack right this time of year. Totally understandable. Not looking for a refund, just thought i should let you know."
Délicieux!
Fish took double the time to cook than as stated.
Potatoes gross. Meat was greasy. Awful.
the bass is always too mushy no matter what we do the past few weeks... wonder if it's from getting refrozen during shipping?
soooo yummy!!
The pesto veggies were delicious. The meatloaf was a little lacking in flavour.
"Awesome, definitely one of the best meals so far. Quick, easy, tons of flavor, no leftovers to be seen!"
I get this whenever it is an option.
"meet loaf was very good, just wished there were more green/healthier veggies instead of potatoes and carrots"
tasty and fairly easy to make
Very easy to make and tasted delicions. I added chicken and shrimp to the meal.
Whole family loved this one! We usually do potatoes instead of sweet potatoes but we might have to switch.
very tasty and quick to prepre.
"Very good. Simple and easy to make, flavorful."
Meal did not have the right meat. It was packaged with a pork serving????
the jerk sauce for the chicken was great! The extra sauce to add to it to make it more flavorful was very spicy. Just add a little and it was perfect!

So delicious!!
Steak had a lot of gristle in it. Hard to chew.
Potatoes tomatoes and cucumber were unusable. I took pictures if you’d like them.
quick and was tasty.
amazing!!
"Would have like to have more of the maple syrup to make extra sauce for the pork, side veggies were delicious and generous portions."
Really liked the garlic and kale combination.
Chicken again
Loved Loved Loved this
The cucumbers were complete rubber. I could bend one in half without it breaking and the tomoto's were over ripe so the skin was so chewy we couldn't eat it. The chicken and potatoes were good.
Amazing
"Delicious recipe. Lacking protein, and we were starving shortly after eating."
"delicious, but wish the pasta was fresh."
This was incredible. The salad was a bit lame. I would've liked tomatoes or more colour to it.
The bell pepper and carrot were so limp they were unusable. Good thing I had my own. Please consider wrapping them so they'll last 4 days
VERY GOOD! However making them into two calzones made them very large. I would have suggested making them into 4 servings
Good.
"Pretty good, different. I typically would have used a bit more ingredients when making a meatloaf from scratch (as it is something I am actually really good at making)."
"It was way to spicy, especially for kids, but even for adults!"
"The rice was kind of bad, I ended up making my own."
dry
I did not order these.
too many noodles not enough other
"was something new for us, pleasantly surprised, great flavor."
A little bland but overall not bad. Had to add hot sauce
Tasted good.. but portions were extremely small
Flavour was good but needs more veggies and the rice noodles were sticky and clumped together even when following the extra note.
Fantastic! The pesto dressing on the potatoes and carrots was inspiring! Yum!
Family loved this and there was plenty for 5-6 people.
sweet potatoes froze in delivery
Delicious!
Excellent
sweet potatoes needed 5x as long to cook than suggested on card.

a bit bland!
Meatloaf a bit dry without a sauce.
Chicken needed to be trimmed and it took awhile. Otherwise great!
Sides weren’t fresh ahain
Would have been better if the carrots were fresh!
The better of the 3 but not great.
It was good
Great
"1 star is too much, terrible!!!"
"I'm not a picky eater, but I have to say this recipe was not very enjoyable. The Jamaican Jerk sauce had a really bad flavor to it, and I actually threw out the tacos that I had put the sauce on."
this was not enough food for 2 people!!! 1.5 servings at most! delicious but a waste of money
So good but need bigger buns
my daughter loved this meal.... was a winner
"Tastes great, chicken was perfect, sauces are yummy but not enough for 2 people, very little rice. Burnt all the broccoli. Also did not choose this meal."
flavourful
taste was good - instructions were left for interpretation in some areas resulting in cooktime greatly increasing
Instructions didn’t match the pictures - two vs. one baking sheets. Normal vs. black sesame seeds. Previously frozen fish tasted like previously frozen. Timing worked well though. Balanced colour/tast
Fish was horrible
Excellent ; very taste and easy to make.

excellent!!!
Portions were out of wack. It was dry. Too many noodles for the ingredients. The prep time was way too long. Not convenient for price.
"Delicious, loved them!"
I would rather pay more for chicken breasts. Half of the potatoes were rotten. The tomato & cucumber too soft to use.
A rotten onion and bruised apple were in the package received. I have emailed pictures to your email as well. Very disappointed as this impacted the overall taste and experience of this dish.
could use alittle bit more greens.
"Delicious, but a little more work than enjoyment"
"The orzo was not tasty. The ""salad"" was bland. The chicken tenders were good though. The lunch was okay despite being very dry."
"I was sent the wrong meal, Maple cider Pork chops. It should have been, Balsamic marinara & Ricotta. Who do I contact to rectify this mixup!"
great recipe could use less carrots and instead some flat peas
Very tasty. High in carbs.
Very tasty
Was kind of bland tasting.
"needed more katsu sauce, a bit more flavour would be nice. Maybe some garlic and ginger."
very tasty but switch the fish to tilipia bass is too soft
Whenever a box includes a cucumber it never makes it to me before it gets wrinkled and soft. Same with cherry tomatoes.
very good! there was a similar recipe a few weeks back that was a bit better which is why I’m giving this only 3 stars but quite good
delicious!
a hot sauce was needed to help melt the cheese
"Decent, way too much kale. Not proportional. Pork chops were good."
DELICIOUS AND EASY
"Fine, but not outstanding. A lot more of noodle than anything else, I would recommend adding more veggies. The sauce was nice, but a little bland."
delicious!
delicious!
Stop sending chicken thighs we want chicken breast back
"these were amazing! I loved the tangy twist on the usual Sloppy joes, would pick this meal again"
"Good recipe, liked the flavors. You send too much spice mix though, barely used half and I could have used even less."
Not enough meat for 4 people

I added chicken and snow peas. Amazing sauce!
this is my favorite thing I've made so far!
I find Basa fish too watery personnel prefference the meal was tasty enough though
Very tasty!
"Simple to make, restaurant quality taste"
"Easy recipe. Nothing new, but tastes good."
amazing we like it
The sausage was too spicy for me.
Package was missing the can of coconut milk. I substituted some skim milk from the fridge. Turned out gross.
Chicken and potatoes were delicious. Only put 3 stars because the cucumbers had froze and could not be eaten
"This was the only meal so far that I did not like. Bland, the amount of peanut butter provided made everything stick together."
excellent!
Excellent taste and super easy to make
The portions were a bit small
Produce was not up to standard.
Way too much spinach! Could have used 1/2 and made a salad with more variety.
Was good
So delicious!
"Super quick, super tasty!"
"It was a lot spicier than we thought, but very good!"
excellent! so easy too.
wonderful meal. really enjoyed this meal
Enjoyed the paste. Did not like the salad.
Excellent and I even added more chicken thighs to the mix and the spices were enough for it all. Family loved it!
a lot of work!
"too dry, too many noodles and not enough vegetables"
Use all of the spinach for filling
fish was unedible. made it exactly like the recipe said and it was like mush.. cooked it longer then after trying with what the recipe said and still mush. My husband actually gagged and spit it out. First bad meal from chefs plate and very disappointed. Salad and sweet fries were okay. overall not happy with this meal.
Not really a meal. Side dish maybe
this was good... LOVED the orzo
Had to add extra cheese/sauce
really easy and tasty
Very good
easily fed three adults with this meal for two
amazing and filling.
SO DELICIOUS OMG!!!!!
SO GOOD!
Super easy! The only piece difficult to replicate would be the coconut lime spices.
"The noodles to veggie ratio was wonderful, and the taste was great."
"I'm not an onion fan, so I skipped the caramelized onions - quicker cook time! I also used a panini press to grill the sandwich evenly on both sides rather than a pan and pressure from a spatula."
"The meatloaf was okay, the veggies were very good though."
"This seemed incohesive, all the individual ingredients were good but it did not make sense together"
These were really tasty and easy to make but need a hint of something else for flavour...cilantro or lime zest.
needed another veg
portion size was very small
Arugula was rotten.
This had no flavour. I had to add stuff to this recipe to actuallu give it taste
Inedible. Salad was rotten.
More vegetables! Two peppers in this recipe would be awesome
Amazing!
"Delicious, could use some kimchi to spice up the slaw."
Delicious
I had way more noodles than veggies.
Really needed some chicken.
Excellent!
"disappointed to see deshydrated pasta and not fresh pasta, no more Chef plate that I loved"
wonderfully large portions!
Unfortunately they didn’t send this recipe.

Delicious! Kids liked it too
I was missing the sweet chilli sauce so the meal tasted like peanut butter it was horrible
Can’t really go wrong with fish tacos usually but these ones were not my favorite. Needed something more
"At first you think, ""Not enough space"" but the flavours were so good, it didn't need to be saucy!"

"Liked the flavour, lacked veggies."
Very easy to make and tastes great
AMAZING! I will order this again
DELICIOUS
chicken was rubbery with though spots
"chewy, rubbery chicken."
"The flavour of honey garlic & sriracha mayo compliment all of the food in this recipe, amazing meal was wishing that I would have had leftovers!"
Received order without black sesame

great vegetarian dish
Too many potatoes and a little heavy on balsamic
Plain tasting
"Subpar chicken cuts, basic ingredients. Not worth the price."
Sloppy Joes were very good. Potatoes were horrible; grey and chewy.
"I have never eaten fish besides deep fried battered fish, so I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this one was!"
"not great value, maybe if tofu was included or more veggies also my carrot was old and unusable"
a great spicy stew with chunks of squash and the mint really works well. Awesome on a cold day to warm up the family.
"didn't end up having, scheduling changed up on us"
I did enjoy this meal! Although my red pepper was on the soft side!
very yummy would have liked a bit more seasoning though
Absolutely scrumptious !
Not enough protien
really great !
just missed a salad or something
I know that meat & potatoes are as basic as food comes but the flavours in this meal were amazing!!! Keep up the great recipes chefs!!
Love the katsu sauce!!! Always delicious
Not enough noodles
Nice
Very easy to prepare (but whyyyy aragula???)
Roasted the green peppers with the potatoes instead of cooking with the beef - it was amazing. Add some lemon juice to the roasted potatoes for a kick!
bread was too long and round to keep things in the panini or squish it down like the recipe said without things falling out or the sandwich tipping over and falling apart
Not really a balanced meal
very tasty
"I made the carrots into ribbons with my peeler instead of half moons, it was easier to eat that way."
"Super easy, fast and yummy!"
"Gravy had cooked off to nothing by the time the meatballs were cooked. Meatballs were tasty, though. Also, would be nice to see something other than green beans as a side veg option."
too spicy
"By the time the meatballs cooked, there was not much gravy left. Would have been nice to have more gravy for plating"
I think this was even better than normal poutine!
"tasted good, but the mini cucumber was soft and mushy and had to be discarded"
rice very dry and sticky
A little bland but good
So tasty; I just wanted a few more veggies for this one.
Didn’t receive all the ingredients needed for the recipe...
Gnocchi tasted old
"Would have been better with cheese inside and out. Also, I didn't receive all the ingredients listed - no cilantro."
Sweet potato came out undercooked (came pre-cooked requiring heating). Butterflys due to shape ended up getting chewy through cooking.
Way too much balsamic vinagar. It actually made my daughter throw up and she's a good eater and not picky at all.
Again rotten vegetable
the cucumber wasn't fresh at all
"Interesting flavors and texture, would do this one again."
A little bland? I don't think the sauce and the rest of the dish matched very well. Definitely not bad though.
"The food was super fresh and delicious as always, the tartar sauce was amazing! But the potatoes are a hassle to cut up, and our package was missing the fish spice mix which was really disappointing."
Could use more vegetables
Fish was kind of bland
Délicieux ce repas!
very tasty. wished you guys used extra lean ground beef though as I find there is a lot of hard pieces in the meat.
Particularly enjoyed the unique side dish.
"Very delicious, just not enough green beans for a family of 4."
spice mix too salty
Very yummy!
amazing flavour combination!
food was great but ingredients provided and pictures of directions were inconsistent.
One of my favorites!
"the meal was good but what really stands out is how well organized the meal plan is, that is something really appreciate"
"Good, but nothing terribly exciting"
fish was light and tasty. spiced mayo was delish
amazing!
"I always try to pick a fish dish, but fish is not my favourite taste necessarily, however, this dish's fish didn't taste to fishy, so for me it was a nice dinner"
chicken a bit rubbery
threw out hapf the lettuce and onions and still had too much. bun didn't fit sandwich stuff and was hard to toast. could have done without onion altogether
was a hit with the kids
turned out ok. the spice mix had too much pepper for my taste
Very flavorful! Easy to make and full of wonderful flavor! Would order again.
Tasty but the gravy congealed.
This recipe ended up being very bland--not worth the price.

not bad
It's great but the amount's quite little.
carrots were soft and wrinkled - definitely past their prime
dough exploded out of bag
Awesome!
Really good. Added chicken to make it more filling. Also didn’t receive the right receipt in the box.
Kale is not my favourite but the rest was good.
"very disappointing, it tasted like spaghetti with peanut butter and so pasty"
"Was missing feta, lunch was dry"
Rotten vegetables
Coding was missing so can’t really speak to what the recipe would’ve been like.
"So tasty, the sauce was creamy and I even had leftovers!"
too much peanut butter - my sauce didn't look anything like the picture so I'm thinking that perhaps I had too much peanut butter in my sauce.
Veggies excellent. Meatloaf lacked some flavor.
We added nire vegetables.
Delicious! Great comfort food. Love the parmesan in the potatoes.
Meal was good. The cucumber that was provided was strating to go bad.
The meal was a big hit but the portion size was too small for 3 adult males + a mom. I had to supplement the meat and potatoes. 4 meatballs & 2 potatoes isn't enough! The produce was very fresh.
Sucked big time because I did not receive it
La salade n'était pas fraîche
"Beef was fine, but the noodles ruined the dish"
Needed a spicy Kimchi on top
a lot of fat and salt in this one but still really yummy
"Terrible. Way too sweet. Couldn't even eat one portion. Needed something to cut the sweetness - maybe more curry paste, fish sauce. Toasted tortilla out of place."
"we liked the recipe and found it flavourful but the sauce didn’t really work out for us as it burned in the pan and all that was left was grease. maybe our fault, not sure we were also hungry after! I’m only 120lbs so it’s not like I’m a giant!"
Loved this!
"Absolutely delicious, so"


So yummy!
This was truly awful and inedible!
Soooooooo good. The salad was a perfect complement to the chicken and the sauce went great with the potatoes.
all the meals i have had so far have been excellent
Cucumber was rotted.
A little spicy for my families taste buds (especially the kids) Coleslaw was great and fresh.
This recipe is super tasty and was easier than expected.
"The pork was lovely as was the sweet potato. The kale was bitter tasting, plus I'm not a kale fan."
Delicious! Everything works perfectly don't leave any of the ingredients out! And we added feta cuz why not.
please indicate what type of dairy is provided - for example I can only eat sheep and goat cheese and the feta in this dish I cannot have because it does not say what type of animal the dairy is from. thank you.
needs spice
one tiny shivelled carrot. :( between that and spring onions it wasn’t worth the cost.
recipe called for far too much liquid (more of a soup than a stew) flavor okay but texture wasnt what I would expect from a stew
Didn’t get my food
Cook time was longer than 15 mins
sauce was bland
"Excellent! I'm not a meatloaf lover, but this was very easy and good. I mixed up a sauce to go with it, and it definately was better with it"
It wasnt very good
"Tasty, but missing steps in the recipe."
Terrible! One carrot and a half bowl of quinoa. Increasing profits by decreasing quality never works!!
I loved the sauce for chicken. I added dill and a little cayenne to the broccoli just elevated it a bit. Great with the sriracha mayo.
kfc chicken yum
Love this dish...it was excellent...
The ratio noodle and vegetables are not weirdly off. There's almost no vegetables when you compare to the mountain of pasta included in this dish. The Bok Choy were very small.
never tried fried Kale before - it was GOOD
Delicious and filling!
Delicious
Loved it! Great recipe. Needs a bit more tomato paste and ketchup though for the amount of meat and veggies you send.
Very enjoyable on all accounts! Chicken was tender and very tasty with the sauce and cheese and couscous was fabulous with the pesto and sauteed peppers. Would absolutely reorder!!
Le choux n'était plus bon pour consommation
Meatballs fell apart
Surprisingly good! nothing to change on the recipe
"missing several ingredients - apple cider vinegar, tortillas and spices"
"very tasty, would have also liked a salad with it!"
Great flavour in the sloppy joes... but very disappointing potatoes (didn’t eat them). A salad of some kind would have been much better.
Amazing. I addred ketchup glaze when i baked it
Delicious flavour for such a simple recipe! Would love to have this again on the menu.
"Great flavour, we would have loved more veggies included in this dish."

Sauce is quite salty and the dish needs more noodles.
I LOVE LOVE LOVED this recipe and have made it three times since!
"It wasn't bad, I found the meatloaf a bit dry."
Use something other than arugula.
Didn't love the fish - it was quite dry.
best meal of the box. the garlic honey sauce paired with sriracha mayo was so good. didnt even bother with the carrots cuz it just doesnt mix well...
Amazing!!
Needed some chicken!
Great quality pork. Didn't like the wilted kale as much as I was hoping.
"Once again, surprise smoke in the flavour pack. I just made my own flavouring, leaving out the smoked paprika. You really should make note of smoke up front. This happened before with a bbq sauce."
To sweet
"Wow, amazing. Kids LOVED it. So easy to make, made it with my 12 year old."
"sandwiches didnt work, too big and messy. meatballs were good"
Loved the flavours of this hearty and very tasty stew. Preparation is so simply and time efficient.
This was OK but without a hot “gravy” the cheese curds didn’t melt - a bit odd
This recipe took longer than 35mins
needed more garlic
we would have added chopped peanuts
not very flavourful but liked having the healthy option!
I don’t like the precooked rice
The texture of the ground beef was unappealing
Cooking beef meatballs this way makes the gravy way too greasy. Tasted more like a greasy diner meal.
Added more of my own veggies too. Was good.
Forgot to put in the bag the breading for the fish
pasta was not the same as shown in picture
Excellent.. great sauce
hot sauce
"Wasn’t the best sandwich I’ve had. The Brie didn’t taste all that great, I’ve had smoother Brie cheese. The spices I think were too smoky for my liking. It was a let down! I had high hopes for this me"
salad has strong greenery flavour marinara sauce tastes like dominoes
"The best part of this meal were the sweet potatoes, which we really enjoyed. The meat and kale could have both used a little more flavor. They were pretty plain."
"Salad was great, gnocchi dressing was tasted too much of the balsamic"
meatballs and pasta...oh ya. The meatball sandwich was a little messy but good.
I was considering pausing my Chef's Plate subscription for a bit to start planning my own menus a bit more but this specific recipe was so good that I unpaused it. So good I wish I had more!
This was good- probably won't use this recipe again!
I would just use the cheese in the potatoes next time - or send less cheese and a lemon. When it's not high quality cheese it feels like dust
"Delicious and unique. On the frying pan it was of course kind of challenging and messy keeping it all together so rather than flipping it, I put it in the over to finish melting/warming up."
Terrible - Bun was like a hot dog bun and only a small onion was provided not enough for 2 meals.
it was hard to stir in the noodles at the end
needs cilantro - that would have been perfect!
"It could have used a creamy element, like sour cream"
Delicious! the breading didn't really stick but it was still so good
turkey was bland even with the seasoning...
I cooked the potatoes for more the double the time and they were still hard:(
very tasty. deserves 5 stars
Great recipe! My children loved it and asked for a second helping
"The basically raw carrots were gross, the Mayo was thick and just didn't work well with the meal and the broiled broc was disgusting and left the house smelling pretty rank."
portion for dinner is small
Loved this soup
"Not enough seasonings, some ingredients like lime were missing"
Our pepper and carrot were both starting to decompose by the time of delivery. Not a big enough portion to satisfy.
Amazing! Do easy and tasted great!
amazing!
"Awesome choice! Easy to prepare, quick cook time, delicious. Can't ask for more!"
way better than it sounds lol
Could have used a bit more gravy
Bun wasn't the best
could’ve used a little less balsamic and a lil more ketchup
"Too much bread, not enough filling. Maybe add grilled tomatoes. Lacked flavor."
Was doubtful because not a huge quinoa fan but it was amazing!
Potatoes were hard to cook. Would have preferred salad side.
La vinaigrette est excellente
Les légumes ne sont vraiment pas assez cuite après 10 minutes. Beaucoup trop croquant à notre goût. On ne les a pas mangé.
"Your vegetable quality has diminished significantly the past few months. For the second week in a row, I received a limp old carrot that was starting to mold."
Always like these ones
"tasty but rolls don’t fry easily, tend to roll and spill the fillings."
Lacked seasoning. Potatoes were not edible after having been in the water pouch and pre cut up.
Good recipe by five years old loved it
not very flavourful. just didn't seem like enough sauce for the recipe.
We have had this before and loved it so we were happy to see it on the menu again. We added a protein to make it more filling but it was delicious!
It was ok. The bun tasted old and stale.
bit too much vinegar for me
Disappointing. Mushy and reminded me of baby food. The best part was the coutons
cucumbers were very soft and could not use them
"We really did not like this recipe. First, an ingredient was missing (the vegetable stock). We also found that the spice pack didn’t easily mix into the turkey."
this was AMAZING!!
"excellent, savory, favourful. would order again"
Missing 2 ingredients
"This tasted great, which was a nice surprise because it smelled awful cooking. The barbecue sauce was hickory flavoured. Not my favourite, but again, we enjoyed it far more than we expected to."
"Even though this dish was delicious, it was not big enough for two meals. You need to add at least two more potatoes!"
good crunch and simple to make
So creative and tasty
Amazing! Loved it
Such a great and easy idea for broccoli.
quinoa undercooked and too salty
"The mayo is a very strange addition, really is not needed (nor compliments the meal at all) Meal was delicious otherwise"
Sriracha not included. But very good
Not sure why you need 2 cookie sheets. I managed with one.
"Lovely flavour, very difficult to keep together and turn while cooking"
Too sweet...
I wish there was another star so I could give it 5! Best meatballs we have ever had.
Needed more veg
Spicier than l'm used to but nice to try.
Soggy and could not add the cucumber since it was soft and moldy!
It didn’t have enough sauce so was super bland.
Was a very good dish
Very tasty
Did not arrive
sauce is overpowering
The portion could have been bigger
didn’t like the onion spice mix
Buns could have been better under the broiler. Burned too easily in frying pan.
The curry paste was missing from my ingredients in my bag and I did not like the flavour of this soup.
Quality of fish substandard
the cucumber was not very fresh
"didn’t feel like we got our money’s worth, small portion and no meat, felt ripped off"
too watery
"Easy and delicious! We aren't fans of feta, so we used grana padano that we had on hand instead."

"Good and flavourful, not quite fulfilling. It needed something a bit more."
Portions are not enough/satisfiying
5 stars if I could!!
too much onion and the flavors were not the greatest
"tasty, but no only dairy-based protein-sources"
Half my meat was missing
Would prefer Halibut
Love Brie. Excellent. So yummy.
did not get hoisin OR ginger. argh
Would be better with a salad. Too many carbs with bun and potatoes
Tasted delicious but the portion per person we very small. We had to cook another meal afterwards.
"Quick, easy, delicious!"
Tasty.
Unfortunately did not receive buns so not the greatest in what I had in stock
Yummmm. Definitely will make this again. As I will with most of the meals we have had.
Very good... but not enough meat for 4 persons
I really enjoyed the chicken and broccoli. The rice not so much. Found it got mushy.
So good!
"Carrot was old and bitter. The rest of the bowl was filling, but bland"
Delicious!
Portions wasn’t big enough for two people as a main course meal. More of everything needed
"Gravy was hard by the time the recipe was finished. Instructions were not easy to follow, esp with the green beans never said to get a new pot of boiling water"
Love this recipe
A bit too spicy for us. But still a good soup
Very good
Really enjoyed this
Sauce had no taste and was too sweet. Portions were small
"Didn’t receive the beef flavouring and received double flour , which ruined the gravey and had no flavour ."
"The Tilapia was a little too fishy, however the rest of the recipe was great and quite filling."
"A little dry, however the flavors were pretty good."
We had trouble getting the rice not to be too sticky. Fish was great.
Could have had more flavour with spices.
It was ok
Good but could have used a bit more flavour. I needed to add more soy sauce and some rice vinegar to add a bit of flavour.
Great broth flavor! I’ll make this again.
Yes yes yes!!! Would love to see this as an option again! Will definitely be recreating this on my own! One of my favourites so far!
Super easy to put all together.
Very tasty but would have liked more veggies.
the gravy dried up during cooking and the meat was a bit tough
the carrot was tiny and floppy so couldn’t grate it or anything .
Needed a bit more of something? Lacked a little bit of flavour...
Quick and easy. My kids ate it!
Better than expected!
Small portion
good flavor
not enough noodles or veggies. Could have used some ginger.
loved the crispy chicken and flavor
Was tasty but the gravy was greasy and then it separated.
meatballs were very dry. little flavor
Yummy!
"Not very soupy (more like a pasta dish), but delicious."
Great flavours. Loved it! Yum
"je n'ai pas du tout aimé le pangasius, il goutait très fort."
"Good flavours, tasty."
"Not much gravy, taste was ok. Easy to make."
"Healthy, but a little bland."
tasty and harty
"Delicious, and portion size was good but needed a little more flavour/spice"
I found instructions confusing - 1 sheet pan vs 2 - broil veg on bottom or to rack
"Winner, had to add more onion as the I got was very small"
One of the best we've enjoyed so far.
We added black beans - delicious!
tasty but a bit soupy
could have used a bit more in terms of portion size! only a small a bit of noodles and chicken
spice mix that came with the onions ruined the sandwich
one of the most delicious Chefs Plate dishes I've had so far
one of ours faves
simple but really tasty
Not a huge fan of talapia
"Great flavour, but much more prep than we thought we were getting into with the 30 min estimate!"
Kind of a weird combo. The salsa made the fries kind of soggy
"Bland, not great flavour"
Very flavourful
Recipe should have contained ginger!
Very plain worst I have had
"loved this, but it didn’t come with nearly enough rice"
"I didn't care for the soy sauce, it made it bitter. I'd prefer more ketchup or a more tomato based sloppy Joe."
meal was great but the cucumber was not very fresh and the onion powder mix was missing
Not enough fish for the amount of tacos it makes. The onion were the best part
Only needed one lime. Not enough soba noodles - could have used twice as much! We don't like cilantro so that was wasted on us:( Croutons were delicious.
Quite drab. Working with you has not been satisfying. The people I dealt with though were excellent.
delicious!
tasty but not great as a main dish
Waaaaay too much of the slaw mix compared to the amount of tortilla shells and fish. Not possible to not waste some of it.
I modified the recipe and put it all together in a casserole and made garlic bread with the ciabatta buns. was outstanding.
Quantity was a bit small for 2 dinners
"Pork was too fatty, so I drained some of the fat."
Love it when you send fresh dough!
very tasty
delicious
was missing ingredients for this recipe
"Our whole family (kids, included!), loved it!"
AMAZING. My favourite Chef’s Plate meal yet
Great recipie. Only suggestion would be a mushroom gravy.
Delicious. I would love to try with butternut squash instead of the sweet potatoes if I were to make this again
"Fantastic,"
Too salty. We threw them out ??
Really good just not enough gravy
The coconut spice was missing from the bag
flavour mediocre
LOVED this one - tastey and easy to make. Added cherry tomatoes to the salad for variety.
Pretty yummy.
It’s a little cheap that you previously provided milk and butter and now you are not. The level of service has declined in the last while. This recipe in particular was a little cheap too...
"My cucumber was rotten when I got it and the salad was very plain, but the sandwich itself was not too bad"
slaw was too dry
portion was too small
The bread was misding
The mash was great

My teenager loves this one.
no flavour
more chicken less carrot
Delicious !
Everyone liked it
I have never had Hoisin sauce before and I have been missing out. Very good meal and very east to make. We loved it!
Soba noodles tasted weird in this
"I did not receive this in my order. I received Moroccan butternut squash stew instead, in error."
The lime was dry and the tomato wasn't even ripe. A little disappointing compared to last weeks meals.
Yum.
Loved this!
Would not make it again
I maybe would’ve added more soy sauce to make the sauce less sticky.
Very hearty
I am not a huge fan of fish but I am a HUGE fan of these tacos!! They are SO delicious!! They would also be the perfect light summer dinner!
Did not arrive
bit boring
Fantastic flavors!
ended up burning the top of my oven - do not brook on the top rack
"carrot was soft, had to toss and use one of my own"
Halve the amount of Worcestershire sauce in this recipe.
Family lived the flavour & very easy to make but the portion size was too small! One sloppy joe per person & a couple of potatoes isn’t enough to feed 3afult men & a mom.
"I really wasn’t a fan of this! it didn’t taste like sloppy joes, at all. when the recipe was complete it only tasted like balsamic vinegar"
the fish was tough to cook
Was good but need more sauce. And meatball did not stay round.
Needed a little ginger and heat.
Portions are not enough/satisfiying
I couldn't quite get on board with adding noodles to this so I left them out. The soup was great and not I've got a bonus pack of noodles ??
Amazing flavours!!
Outstanding!
It just wasn’t as exciting g as I thought it would be
Yummy but could’ve used more sauce!
loved this and the soba noodles were a perfect match (much tastier than chow Mein noodles)
"It was not what we expected. Not sure if it was the noodles or the sweet potato but it was too ""starchy"". Not a soup."
Excellent
"The pepper had a dead bug inside, and was rotted. I threw it out. Otherwise fine"
"I love fish but my wife isn't keen on it, so we won't be ordering much fish in future unless it's salmon or something similar"
Cooking then in the pot the cheese didn't melt so well and the sandwich fell apart a bit.
Delicious!
"Lots of food, very good"
Not much veg and the flavour wasn’t great
Delicious!
Easy and tasty
left the dry parmesan out of potatoes..real cheese is better with potatoes or no cheese..gravy was good though
a second veggie would be good
So good! Everyone loved this and I love how fast it was!
Excellent - loved this dish. I used my own garlic in case the one supplied was from China
Tasty and produce was gorgeous! Sauce was a little salty for my taste.
I was disappointed the package of cabbage was brown. I had to throw it out.
Really tasty

This was a weak recipe. One small carrot for two people for a vegetable?
Omg my fave new way to do mashed potatoes!!! Kids loved this one...
I did not like the precooked rice at all!!! There would have been time to do fresh rice so I dont get it...the chicken had flavor though...it was good
Best fish recipe I’ve tried from you guys
We weren’t a huge fan of the meatball seasoning but it wasn’t too bad. Wish they provided a different pasta because it felt hard to eat-too long and sauce didn’t really adhere to it.
Really yummy! This recipe is one I will for sure recreate.
Way too small.
some produce weren’t very fresh
OK. Needed more flavour
Would have enjoyed more gravy so there would be some for the mash potatoes.
Broccoli burns and sriracha didn’t fit
very tasty!
Solid and simple. Great flavours.
Loved this dish!
"Very nice, but the ""croutons"" turned instantly soggy. Some tofu as well would have been nice."
Great recipe
"Really good, I'd like to get this one again"
too salty
A hit with everyone. Delicious!
"Butternut squash seemed freezer burnt. The texture was weird, it was all slimey..."
Loved it
This was awesome. Loved the meatballs and gravy. And the beans were tasty.
Delicious! I added some tofu for protein.
"Too much quinoa, not enough vegetables."
very nice ...loved the naan bites.
Instructions did not advise to boil water for the noodles
Really good
sauce was too sweet chicken was tough
Best meal yet
"Best meal yet, everything worked well"
The sauce was way too sweet and the cabbage was brown.
The green beans needed more flavor. the Meatballs and potatoes were great.
The sloppy joes were easy to make and tasted fantastic!
Not very filling
Super yummy. Would definitely make again.
chicken was blah the rest was great
"The chicken was really gross, had hard gristly pieces, everything else tasted good but I couldn’t finish it"
Amazing flavours!
Very good
easy and delicious
This meal was a huge hit!! It was simple to prepare and the flavours were incredible!
Tasted great! Again was in need of something more. This was more like a side dish.
"Not bad, a pretty easy dish to throw together. I wish it had been a bit spicier, but apart from that it was quite good."
Even my picky daughter loved them!
"Usually the fish taco recipes are quite good, but I found this to be very bland. Would have preferred onions that were not pickled, too - the flavour seemed a bit off overall."
Very delicious
Meal not balanced - not enough veggies
interesting and different - we enjoyed the flavours
Too salty
Would of been good if I received the panini
"When I was unpacking the Chef Plates box, the outside of the chicken and fish packages were wet and there was a pink clear liquid in the box as the chicken packages were sealed properly on top."
Mediocre. Kind of dry.
Most horrible fish
Carrot was rotten
Delicious meal!
Underwhelming.
Would love to see this again! Could add a couple more veggies and some peanuts too but not necessary
I honestly forgot how much I hate the mouldy fish flavour of tilapia. Unfortunately no amount of teriyaki sauce could hide that. Otherwise the veggies were delicious and the broiling of the fish was fast
The spanakopita were delicious. The salad dressing left a bit to be desired.
Easy to make and so delicious!
good side dish or appetizer
Not a lot of taste to the fish but still quite good
kinda fell apart
Too spicey
Yummmmmmm
Very flavourful
Very tasty and easy to make. Bun looked a bit like a large hotdog bun though and not as shown on website
Very good but portion size was quite small. We actually made more food for ourselves after eating this meal.
Not a fan of your fish. Worry about it bring farmed.
Easy to make.
Wasn’t aware the fish was tilapia...bottom feeder fish-yuk!!
This recipe is a keeper!
Quite good tasting but I would have preferred sliced pork rather than ground.
Gravy started to reduce and thicken too much before meatballs fully cooked. Added tomato sauce to salvage dish. Still enjoyed.
tasty and generous...I was too full
So tasty!
Was not as flavorful as I had thought
too many pans and pots that need to be used for this recipie
"Great meal, everyone, even the teenagers ate it, but it would have been better with better quality ground beef, I know it said lean, but I have my doubts."
This was delicious! Please repeat this dish!!!!!
It took much more than 30 min to prepare and I have many years experience in cooking. Had to use too much pots and pans. The dish turned out good though
The garbage wasnt fresh. Brown edges.
gravy did not work out...was lumpy and coked away......meatballs fell apart. taste was good though
"I was not expecting this to be nearly as delicious as it was, but wow! This was great!"
Tasty
bad instructions = burnt bun
Just ok
Very tasty and easy to make.
Didn't like the Teriyaki sauce
Love this recipe! Keep it in the rotation please!
Delicious.
This was amazing taste wise and filling! would order this again for sure!
These were awesome!
not enough gravy
Super good but I just thought that it came with way too much lettuce!
All that it tasted like was vinegar. Tasted bad. I would not even give one star if was an option.
Would rather make our own rice. And not add vinegar. Too much.
Excellent sauce and veggies were very tasty
Excellent meal. So quick and easy that my husband could handle it!
"Red pepper was frozen, could not use"
"Another quick, healthy meal that is easy to put together. The flavours were excellent. I loved the mint added to the feta"
Potatoes were a weird grey colour and took 4x longer to cook then directed.
salad had already started going bad only had it in the house for two days
carrot was horrible and could not use you need to go back to the old bags for shipping
everything great!
Loved the potatos and a great way to cook the meat balls after the gravy to give extra flavor but the beefs was so chewy and I didn’t love the seasoning in the meat balls
Don’t over mash your yams or your soup will be super thick - but still tasted great
Easy to make but only average in taste. The veggies were really close to being off. Floppy carrot and some mold on the pepper.
delicious
Tasty and easy! We loved it.
this meal was the only one that was salvageable.
Just ok
I omitted the cornstarch and this was BEAUTIFUL!
This was ok. I think it would be better with a more flavorful cheese.
Used the meat for the meatball recipe as potion was too small.

Some of the pre roasted potatoes were rotten in the package and a couple of the fresh potatoes were bad also that came with the meat balls and gravey
Time way off for the broccoli. Crispy critters. Luckily I told husband not to trust it!
Very tasty
there were no olives included in our package
timing of recipe was a bit off but flavour was good
Delicious
Very tasty even minus the carrots which were slimy and the fly that was packaged with the broccoli.
"Loved the dish, however carrot in it was so soft it could be bent into a circle without snapping. We have had a number of experiences in the past few week with produce lacking freshness."
Did not make this yet because the cabbage was brown and I did not have cabbage on hand.
"Flavours and idea was good, difficulty keeping it all together when cooking. Instructions were not super clear."
Too much vinegar in the reciepe
Absolutely delicious! I did warm up the carrots a little. The sriracha mayo has just the right amount of heat and is a nice balance with the sweetness of the honey garlic sauce.
Very good meal
AWESOME!
"Awesome recipe, not so awesome produce"
Would it have been better to make the gravy using butter instead of oil? It seemed to separate leaving chunks.
Lacked flavour
"Recette goûteuse, mais 5 minutes de cuisson pour les poivrons rouges c’est un peu trop et pas assez de cuisson pour les carottes"
onion was missing from our bag
Brie was missing so subbed cheddar we had. It was OK
Tasty
The gravy was really oily and not a gravy at all
I had some issues with the gravy drying out as I wanted to ensure that the meatballs were appropriately cooked.
this was excellent - very hardy - could have had more gravy tho
again needed more seasoning and sauce and instead of potatoes - a green side veg would be better
not a fan of the noodles
I feel like it needed more than just red peppers and onions. Felt pretty boring on the palate compared to other recipes
Bland
So delicious!!
One of the best sandwiches I have ever tasted.
Tasty but the portion seemed very small compared to what we typically get.
More seasoning for the green beans
lacked flavour
Good mix of flavours. I like the veggie stock with the quinoa.
The buns were too small for the amount of content to go in.
very nice flavour
Definitely try this one again.
kids adored this. wished we had more meatballs!
wasn’t a fan of the pre-cooked rice
"I think the recipe itself would have been great but the cucumber that arrived was half rotten, moldy and turning to liquid. I ended up substituting my own produce."
great meal quick and easy. Would definitely do this one again.
Wife was wanting fish tacos for the longest time. Gave this a whirl. Was worth it. Simple to make. Did not take long to do and enjoyed. Plenty to go around.
too vinergary
Needs cheese or something else on it
"Did not seem to go very far, portion sizes seem to be getting smaller."
Did not receive ??
little bit spicy
"Nice balance, great smoky taste."
"Rice a little bland, all else good, sauce is spicy."
Nice flavour
the potatoes were too mushy I think 1/4 cup of water was a little much. otherwise it was really good
Very tasty! Especially with the lime.
So good! Our favourite !
the green beans were delicious! The meatball sauce was so yummy!
"Needs a little more taste, a little bland, but very good."
Really enjoyed this recipe!
"Good flavour, easy to make, but the beans were not fresh and had brown spots the day they were delivered."
Very good chicken and really liked the sriracha mayo.
wanted more buns
AMAZING TASTED DELICIOUS
Fish was ok. Basa is better.
bomb.com
Both potato rotten had to be replaced with my own
Fish was kind of dry. Might be nice with a side.
not enough flavor
Full of flavour!
Yummy
Tasty but the cucumbers were water logged.
Love this recipe but would prefer it on something more than a hotdog bun
"This was more like a lunch - salad very basic, not good value at all"
Easy and tasty
AMAZING
soo good! The gravy didn’t turn out but it was very tasty
Quick and delicious!!
"The dish needed something additional added ie. beans, or another veggie."
"The cucumber provided was tiny, wrinkled and soft so it couldn't be used. Salad was boring. It was difficult to get the cheese melted and apples warm without burning the bun."
Did not like the cooking method and ended up blowing the meatballs first. Gravy did not turn out.
Good!
Missing an ingredient
"The spice was way too overpowering. This dish had potential, but the overpowering spice unfortunately made it unenjoyable. It wasn’t just the level of spice that was too much, since that is subjective. It was also the flavour of the spice - it was all that could be tasted."
The rice was delicious.
Love all your sandwiches... you need more.
Needed a bit more texture. Tasted good but was kind of mushy.
It was so cool to make french fries from scratch!
One of the best things we've had.
"Meal was okay, but we skipped the potatoes. A salad would have been a much better side - something with contrast."
The pepper was nearly liquid it was so over-ripe. Luckily I had a spare. Treated pretty good and was very easy.
Very good meal. Easy to prepare and lots of it.


The soup was delicious
Fantastic flavour
very good very tasty
AMAZING
Buns are too soft for this kind of dish. They just fell apart. Maybe kaiser rolls would be better.
"Very easy and super tasty. Gravy came out really fatty on top due to the fat in the ground beef, but it can be skimmed if you try."
Good but we got almost no gravy.
The ingredients sent were hardly enough to make a single serving let alone two. The flavour was fine.
I didn't like the sauce.
"Sorry, the tilapia fish tasted muddy."
This was pretty bare in my opinion. It needed another veggie to be added to it.
Luckily my husband wasn’t home as there just wasn’t enough chicken for 4 people. The veggies didn’t look too quality. My 13 year old made the entire meal without supervision and itvwas a tasty meal.
"very yummy, portion on the smaller side but easy and yummy"
Considering the number of ingredients that went into the turkey itself...not a lot of flavour
The food itself was good what wasn’t was the missing sour cream we had to run out and buy in the middle of cooking our meal.
great burger! salad dressing was strong on the balsamic side but good meal overall!
Cheesy mash is my new favorite thing after eating this meal ?
I wasnt loving this meal it was very very spicy and no matter how much teriyaki glaze I put on it still tasted way over fishy and the rice didnt cook up great at all.
Didn't love the meat balls. Potatoes were good.
Was not a fan of the sauce. Peas and potatoes were nice.
"Great meal, however the carrot received was so soft it was gross."
There wasn’t enough Halloumi to cut into 4 “steaks”. every other time we have received Halloumi it has been a package.
Didn’t taste anything like a beef sloppy joe. Wouldn’t order it again.
Amazing and want it again
Direction were missing an important item — the oven temperature
Again Quite spicy and I didn't use the jalapinos
roast broccoli in the oven on broil for 14 minutes? Was burned when I went to flip it at 7 minutes
Delicious but gravy was a bit oily
The red rice was bland and mushy. The rest was good.
"The 15 mins recipes are hit and miss. The burger was good, but the potatoes were awful!"
"Very bland. I added spinach and some aromatic salt. Also, the risotto stuck together badly. I had to chunk it a part with a spoon."
"Meat was too fatty, and not enough spice on it"
The greens went bad before we could use them :(
Awesome!!
Very good.
"The potatoes weren’t edible, wasn’t worth the extra money"
Simple and delicious!
Tasted great but a bit high in calories
way more spicy than we expected!
No stars if it would allow. Potatoes were grey and nasty looking. Meat dry and tasteless.
No flavour at all.
Great recipe! Needs a bit more buffalo breading or the chicken though!
Would have liked some green veggies or salad with this.
Excellent dish
really yummy - decent portion! super easy to make
"Good, but a bit more kale would've been nice."
tasty but felt it needed an additional veggie side
i would rate 3.5 stars... the bbq sauce was overpowering but all in all a filling yhmmy meal!
we only received 5 tortilla shells which didn't end up mattering because the fish portion was so small there wasn't enough for 2 tacos each
Yum!
"Flavour was great, but the sweet potatoes were tiny and not fresh; overall, the meal was very small, so I added an extra medium sweet potato and a dozen medium shrimp to make the meal enough for us"
"The Teriyaki sauce was not in the bag. I made my own from scratch, but I had a guest for dinner and the timing got messed up. The meal turned out well though."
Some texture would have made it better I think
"bit spicy, I used half the spice"
REALLY yummy. We added a couple of potatoes
"The dressing is so good! Quickest recipe by far and so tasty, would have been even better with some bacon bits but hey, healthy right?"
"If you truly want an honest opinion, I think you folks are dropping the ball. At first we thought your recipes were outstanding ... now not so much. If you want some honest feedback, call 416-726-4931"
"We were pleasantly surprised! It was delicious! And so quick and easy to make! Whole family enjoyed it, teenagers were the ones to cook it up- simple and fast!"
could have been a bit spicier but we still enjoyed it a lot
was tasty but the fish needed more cooking time than the recipe called for so needed to juggle a bit. would have enjoyed some carrots and/or peppers in with the broccoli for more variety and taste
delicious!!
too salty
Loved the kick of the spice in this recipe. Delicious!
"this was my most disappointing meal. the gravy was very bland, the mustard just didn’t work here. also, I don’t like sour cream so I omitted it from the potatoes, I added butter instead. another green veg might be a good idea. I threw most of out and ate a yogurt instead :("
bland
Good but slightly bland.
Who knew a side of carrots could be so delicious!
"Flavours were good, but not enough pesto sauce and bun was stale"
you gave me the WRONG ORDER with garbage supplies
yummy but too many pots and pans
Good
A little too spicy for some family members
Fantastic dish. I would give it four stars!
only received 2 small carrots so wish we had more because they were delicious. steak was weirdly cut and chewy
so much noodles !
This was absolutely delicious!!

Very tasty and love the leftover option
love the addition of garlic to the potatoes!
Recommended time to boil the noodles was too long. Either reduce the time or modify instructions to remove from heat after adding noodles to the boiling water
not enough food for 2 people. needed a green vegetable
Amazing sauce and flavours but like other breaded recipes on CP the breading supplied is far too little to cover all the meat. I feel ripped off.
The broth didn’t have as much flavour as I hoped it would. Tasted mostly like coconut milk and water. Maybe more spices needed at the start
"one of the Roma tomatoes were flattened, I assume by the can of beans"
This recipe was really unclear and very confusing. What should be an easy and tasty recipe is missing one too many words on the card. Really disappointed.
this was really good but I added fish sauce and lemon to the sauce - made it even better
tasted great
super
meatball spices not great
"les crudités n'allaient pas trop avec le reste, il aurait fallu quelque chose de plus consistant"
"Easy to make, not bad, my son loved it"
Needed bit more sauce
Was much better than anticipated- actually really enjoyed it
the burger was amazing. was not a fan of the salad
Easy and yummy
Pork cutlets were excellent. Needed some green veggies to complete the meals
Was really looking forward to the mushroom sauce but all I could taste was mustard. Was way too overpowering.
celery was a lil flimsy... great dish though
Good - only used a bit of the Miso butter as it was very rich.
Good. Chips were the best part!
Hubby super impressed to have nachos for supper. Cilantro froze sitting on my step so didn't use it but was pretty good quick supper
"Very good, but only got two small carrots for two people"
Delicious! Ample supply of fresh tortillas.
Your font is so light I cannot read it.



small serving size and hard to make without everything falling out
Very yummy but not very filling.
"There were not enough veggies, some raddish and lettuce would have made this more or a bowl, also it seems there is a problem in the packaging department there was no label on the bag, no nutri info."
"weird proportions of vegetables, very small carrot for example"
"I omitted the potatoes and substituted potato chips and a salad, Again , truly enjoyed the seasonings, taste of the beef mixture"
"chicken was rancid, threw the whole kit away"
Tasty and flavourful!
"Spice mix for the caramelized onions was too smoky, making the onions inedible. Also the cucumber in in my bag was so soft & limp it was hard to tell it was a cucumber. Salad mix had turned brown too."
Good but Very Rich for my wife
carrotts and celery were rotten 3 days after delivery and the portion size was tiny
halloumi was a small peice and was barely present. red pepper was yellow and already starting to turn.
a little too sweet to be called a sloppy joe.
½ of the ingredients went bad after 3 days
Pork was amazing but theres never enough vegetables.
I liked the slaw dressing.
Great flavor but the yellow pepper(not red as pictured) was mushy!
could have had larger carrots
the roasted veggies were excellent
Not enough for two people
"Added garlic & ginger - recipe should have contained those two. Otherwise, very good!"
wasnt great but wasnt bad either
Soooo good. Please add it again soon!
Really enjoyed this.
"It was ok, the sauce was kind of bitter"
Serving of turkey was too small
Perhaps a little too strong on the teriyaki sauce?
"We didn't use up all of the tzatziki. You could have included less! The cherry tomatoes were difficult to quarter and kept squirting everywhere. Otherwise, excellent!! The potatoes were delicious."
Tasty and easy! Couldn’t ask for more.
May have not done quinoa properly.
Delicious but would have been nice to have written in the instructions to put the potatoes on the middle rack of the oven
These were good but the pasta was an awkward shape and size for eating this way. It was like eating lasagne noodles as spaghetti
I dont like roasted broccoli so steamed it but otherwise this was good
"Great dish, lots of taste"
not my taste. not sure why but I didn’t enjoy this one
the recipe said to include 1/2 cup of water for the gravy. it was far too little and we had to keep adding liquid to cook the meatballs properly and not end up with the sauce stuck to the pan.
yay! i got all my ingredients however this is the last time I will be ordering chefs plate as each week I seem to get recipes that are missing ingredients or half rotten veggies
My Husband and Brother were both very pleasantly surprised by the gangly zip that the balsamic vinegar added to the sloppy Joe's.
same comment very simple and could of thought and made this myself without help
"Fish tasted too fishy, meal was pretty bland. Really disappointed as the other fish meals we have had were so tasty!"
Would have needed more veg
lack of flavor
Kids favourite!!
my cucumber was not useable - it may have froze and was mushy
"My favourite so far, love the flavour!"
It was very good / I was really impressed with freshness and quality of the green beans and red pepper and it was nice to follow a different way of preparing. Won’t order fish dish - Farmed ??
Very enjoyable
the tilapia was too overwhelming it would have been better if it was basa
Gravy evaporated before the meatballs had time to cook.
"quinoa cooking time/amount of liquid were a bit off, but otherwise quite tasty"
I had to add ingredients for flavor...but the idea was there...
Awesome!
The fish was too fishy tasting. Not good enough quality
"Absolutely delicious, and easy to make."
Great steak and everyone loved the corn!
"Noodle portion was small, and taste overall wasn't great. Cabbage had gone a little brown and mushy."
I added cumin which was a nice additional flavour boost.
"Delicious, but the portions were a little on the small side for us!"
"Pretty good, but it would have been nice to have a higher quality fish than pollock. The slaw-to-everything-else ratio was also way off – we had a massive amount of leftover slaw, and we used tons!"
Carrot was so limp I could hardly grate it.
too sweet
Did not like being forced to have sugar with no advanced warning. Not something we usually have on hand.
Not as flavorful as the other meals this week
Flavour was nice but the texture was mushy and not very appetizing.
"super easy, super yummy!"
My husband liked it. I couldn't eat it. The spices were too strong tasting. I also think it would have been better with sweet potatoes instead.
Would have been nice to have protein such as tofu to make it a complete meal.
Tacos were good. We added hot sauce and it was much better. But slaw was boring...
"Wasn't actually that spicy, but fixed that with hot sauce. Slaw was booooooring."
Okay meal. However it was curated so I wouldn't have picked it otherwise.
Quality of the ingredients are very disappointing.
2.5 stars
Perhaps the best chefs plate we’ve made! Absolutely amazing! And easy!
tortillas were very dry and did not improve with the baking
Good
This was delicious!
sloppy Joe's were good but potatoes tasted weird
Basil was wilted.
Awesome flavors and easy to make!
"sandwich was good, salad greens were mushy didn't end up using them."
"fish did not taste good, black sesame seeds where normal sesame seeds"
My husband made this tonight and I think it was the first meal besides toast and eggs that he's ever made. It was AMAZING.
A bit bland
"I was unable to make this recipe using the ingredients provided as the cucumber was inedible when they arrived, as were the potatoes (black in the inside). This was very disappointing."
Nice combination of flavours! I added an extra onion because they really shrunk. If I were to make it again I would use softer apples.
Very tasty blend of the ingredients.
Strong flavours
Wasn’t overly filling. Could have used more than an extensive amount of salad as a side. We actually had to make more food after. The sandwich tasted amazing though and we both wanted more of that.
Having it tonight.
These weren’t that good flavour wise! I think this might have been a quick meal that cost extra but the fish was frozen solid when I got it so it was anything but quick! I couldn’t delay the meal.
Delicious and very filling!
The shrimp taco recipe is soooo much better than this one! Disportionately more slaw than fish.
A subtle sweetness...will order again!
Very tasty.
the cucumbers were mushy and half the potatoes were black and inedible
The creativity in recipes is deteriorating.

We did not receive tomato paste with our recipe
Simple to make
Really want to make this one again.
The vegetables were frozen couldn’t use
Best chefs plate to date
"Very tasty recipe, loved it."
"Good recipe, did not like the balsamic vinegar in the recipe, would have preferred it without. But that may just be my taste."
"This was the best recipe for the week, a family favorite"
"I always prefer a chicken breast over the scrap chicken, would pay more for better quality meat"
"J'ai invité des amis pour venir goûter. J'ai aimé plus ou moins, mais je ne le ferai pas une deuxième fois, ça a pris du temps à préparer."
Tasty.
We'll be making this one again!
not bad for a snack but certainly not a meal
"potatoes and green pepper were frozen so I had to discard. Same with veggies from poutine recipe, very disappointing"
Tasty. Not enuf dressing for coleslaw. Had to add mayo which improved texture but lessened the delicious spice which was not so good thing.
I used less than half of the teriyaki sauce... DELISH!
Yummy! If I were to mak it again I’d chop the spinach up.
The gravy did not turn out at all and just burnt to the pan despite following directions exactly.
We like unique flavours.
"Ok, nothing great"
INCREDIBLE!!!!!
Meat and potatoes portions too small

The cucumber was a little wilted and the lettuce at the bottom of the bag had gone bad. I don't know if it was because the lettuce had travelled to me on top of the ice pack or not?
The greens and cucumber froze in transportation so we only had the sandwich.
Never got the order due to weather and delivery
Prepared and ate this meal on day 4 and potatoes were grey and really unappetizing looking...threw them out.
Beans were tough
Delicious. Great portion size.
"also bland, not much flavour to it bit lunch rather than dinner."
Would have been great without the balsamic vinegar
Wouldn’t do the precooked potatoes again . The sandwich was really good
added more veggies. throw in a carrot or something.
This one was really good!
We never received our order
"Salad was a bit too basic for my tastes, but the sandwich was fantastic!"
very tasty
"""Broccoli burns and sriracha didn’t fit"""
really tasty
error in instructions
Produce was old/wilty and ingredients missing
"peppers were not usable, and potatoes not at all fresh. also no balsamic as called for in the recipe"
Poisson succulent! Il manquait la température du four dans la recette
This recipe was ok. Just ok. Something was missing...maybe it's onions but it just lacked flavor and excitement. The sauce seems very artificial and high in sodium.
Delicious!
We are always looking for higher protein and lower carbs. We used the potatoes in a lentil soup the next day.
Interesting recipe and was more filling than we expected
"Excellent, yet could be improved if fresh, rather than pre-cut, squash was used."
More spice / more of a kick!
Awesome meld of flavours!
The produce wasn't very fresh
Potatoes not the freshest and the gravy was not enough
Not s fan of roasted broccoli. Rest awesome
carrot and beet were way to small for 2 people. either need 2-3 of them or bigger ones.
Yum! Garlic and paste toasting was simple... excellent aroma from the start.
Was not filling at all and the pickled onions were not good. I am glad for the regular tortillas though because the older style always fell apart. Fish was good.
didnt love the meat mixture...
Found the gravy a little salty but it was really good
"My favorite this week, delicious and easy to make"
Wasn't our favourite but was a decent change.
Bread was too bulky vs quantity of cheese. All we could taste was bread and onions.
Was OK. Not fond of the new little bags that need a scissors to open as they don't pull apart. The zip lock ones from before are better.
Didn’t taste good at all
This was absolutely delicious. The best dinner I’ve had yet.
This recipe bag didn't come in the box.
"Very good, easy to make, large potions."
A bit bland. Something tart (cranberries?) as a counterpoint would have been nicer than the sweet mustard
Didnt like the chicken was missing something tasted bland.
Surprisingly delicious!
Really liked the combo of bok choy and pork. The sauce left something to be desired.
the flavors were pretty light/bland
Tasty but did not look as good on the plate!
Leftovers were very dry but when fresh very good.
"Didn't love the potatoes, they took much longer to cook then the recipe called for. But the sloppy joes were delicious"
Basa works better for tacos. Pollock has a very unpleasant aftertaste
Carrots. went bad before I used. Then but the rest was onk
"A little more involved to make, but very tasty!"
Quick and healthy.
Delicious.
The onion was rotten on the inside and the cucumber was soft and prune like
The beans we’re a bit chewy. Fish was excellent.
Not really a fan of using the vinegar with it. It kind of tasted odd with it.
fish was fishy and meal was bland
loved this. added a bit of chopped green onion and it really worked with the sriracha mayo
pork wasnt crispy
We found the produce not very fresh
Delicious!
The rice didn’t taste good because of the pre cooking - really disappointed.
"Liked the pesto vinaigrette, meatloaf was a simple recipe"
Easy and delicious!
Very tasty just not enough!
not enough carrots!
would be nice to have more vegetables with it
Not enough of a salad.
recipe was ok. potatoes were pretty banged up. liked the cheese on the beans and potatoes.
"Quality of ingredients was good, but the sauce was unpleasant and overpowered the dish."
Potatoes were rotten
Yummy!
meat portion was too small
I did not recieve my box in the mail. So I wouldn't know.
the meatballs kinda fell apart. they could use a binding agent.
This was a solid ok. Buns were stale even though this was made within 2 days of delivery. but this was the only meal that my daughter would have again.
Amazing!
trop épicé!!
very tastyI


Absolutely delicious!
"Interesting combination, and enough coleslaw for another meal."
Fantastic! Loved it and it made a great lunch the next day too!
"Feels weird to give it four stars because it wasn't nearly as good as the Thai soup, but this was also good. I love Katsu sauce"
Loved loved this dish. Excellent in every way. Highly recommend.
Potatoes needed to be altered (you just can't make them with butter and cheese alone - milk or cream or something is needed). Meatballs were lacking - beef provided was lackluster.
"Meals were tasty, easy to prepare and there was enough food for three people."
an ok spin on the original- but I’d rather have the traditional kind
chicken was bad
Best mac and cheese we've had from Chefs Plate.
"Quick, easy and the honey garlic chicken with the Sriracha mayo got rave reviews from my fiancé ??"
made me ill!
The carrots and celery were loose in the bag so they were limp and not edible. Not sure why you have stopped putting the vegetables in a ziploc bag.
Very easy to make but fairly plain- too much carb; wish there was more vegetables
too spicy for our children
good but a little bland
was ok but wouldn’t order again
2 carrots given were bad/ garbage I couldn’t even peel them. Raw carrots should be crunchy. Luckily I had my own carrots & I added cauliflower and celery for more food / veggies. Meatloaf was good.
Great for people who like spicy food. Just a little too spicy for me.
Instructions for potatoes had too much liquid.
YUMMMM
"only ""ok"". needed more spice."
"I didnt get hoisin sauce so used maple syrup. was unsure of how much to use and im sure it wasnt the same. meat had refrozen when i picked it up, causing food safety concerns."
Very spicy! Loved it!
Portion size large. Good but not exciting.
our carrots and celery were really limp and our some of our potatoes were rotten
delicious - a little more sauce
More sauce would have been nice!
This was excellent...the beans sent were perfect and when roasted with peppers were great
"I have to admit I really had my doubts about this combo but since I found your vegetarians dishes excellent, thought I would give it try. We LOVED IT..! my husband asked me if we had more..nope"
Superb..really .loved the sriracha mayo...
Yummy!
"This wasn't soup, it was tasty slosh, perhaps the recipe should call for more water"
"Mashed potatoes were watery, not creamy. One onion is too much for 2 servings. Where are the vegetables?"
Burger was fantastic. Needs protein.
yummy burger. salad probably didnt need that much balsamic vinegar but great meal anyway
AMAZING! please have it again!
Meatballs would have been better with bread crumbs and an egg to make them less course but were okay
We added more beef to make a few more meatballs and there was enough gravy for them as well!
This dish needs a green salad.
"Quite good! I was a big fan of the chow mein noodles and the broccoli, the fish was high quality as well."
"à part la qualité des légumes, mais je vous ai déjà contacté. c'était excellent."
A side salad would have been nice to balance out the meal.
This was one of the best lasagna’s I’ve ever eaten! Love the fresh pasta sheets!
Very tasty
"Recipe was good, but my cucumbers and potatoes were both rotten by the next day so I had to use sweet potatoes and my own cucumbers."
Very easy and super tasty!
needs a 2nd veggie/greens or small salad
This meal was missing an ingredient.
"Went together quick but I wouldn't call this a ""meal"" more of a snack. The chips tasted stale and not sure why this was extra $ per serving. Not good value."
The meat was tender and tasty but there was almost too much spiciness in all 3 dishes combined.
Step 1 — cut the halloumi into 2 or 4 steaks (for 2 servings?). Confusing. It was really skinny to begin with. And there was too much balsamic. But the flavours were good!
"rice was bit odd, I wish there was a temperature written for baking."
"Flavour was wonderful! Though we felt there were too many noodles for the amount of veggies and meat provided. We ended up adding in extra carrots, onions and bell peppers."
Was not fond of the mustard added in. Next time I'd leave it out.
Amazing
Excellent
The recipe made no sense - pictures didn't match up and I couldn't tell what they wanted me to do. This was a horribly written and made recipe.
Very good but the steamed rice was hard out of the package and took a long time to break down
a little thick but I will add more water next time. I just used tortilla chips and skipped frying up tortillas. would have preferred this as a chicken option vs vegetarian.
The meat was not tender but rather tough. The rice was average but the carrot were awesome. Will not order it again. It was our meal with beef. Reluctant to order further meals with beef.
Not enough chicken for 4 adults. Veggies were frozen upon arrival; could not use celery - garbage. Good flavor for spices & sauce.
Too spicy for kids and me.
Too much bun. Better open faced.
"Needed a better side, more chicken"
Everyone really enjoyed this meal
"It was okay, not as flavourful as we expected."
great idea but the rice was in chunks and it needed way more liquid
"A little dry on the buns, and a little bland"
"Really great. Would add 1/2 cream, 1/2 milk for a thicker stickier sauce"
We didn’t like that the butternut squash was still a little raw. Instructions didn’t allow for it to cook enough. Didn’t like that the rice was precooked. Was very clumpy
Boring compared to Thai Koh soi takeout. Not enough sauce and no broth
Absolutely delicious and properly portioned
"this was really great, it was much better than we both thought it would be. look forward to having this again."
delicious
"pork did not arrive, celery was frozen"
Very delicious!
"Absolutely loved this. Bok choy is probably my fave vegetable, the steak was a nice cut and the miso butter was a tasty touch"
"It's pretty much just nachos, but still pretty darn good!"
excellent. Juste assez épicé
"Loved the miso flavour, and the spicy rice!"
"Too much mashed potatoes, little protein for 2 people. Flavors were good!"
Very tasty and easy
Incredibly boring and the meal I would make if I ran out of food in my pantry.
Super delicious.
was great. had a great cut of steak
"Please bring back, so good"
a little too salty
"This recipe is a keeper! I will certainly make this again, everyone loved it and I felt good serving such a healthy option!"
"Was nice, celery wasn’t edible thought."
Excellent
did not like taste
this steak was amazing!! best piece of meat!!!
We had one package of Halloumi to share between 4 people so the Halloumi part of the burger was lost with in the big bun. Next time I would send 2 packages of Halloumi for 4 people.
Very good!
Terrible
this was delicious and easy enough to prepare for my husband to actually cook dinner tonight!
"pork chops were very tasty, unfortunately the potatoes were under seasoned and 1/2 of them were rotten."
The halloumi part was excellent but the spinach salad was kind of boring
not good
really good. I added two cooked chicken breasts while simmering so that may have been part of the issue but in the end there was very little liquid. it was more of a stew than a soup. but it was tasty and the chips on top were a nice addition
"A bit bland, but ok. Not many veggies in it."
For celiacs it would be great if alternative noodles were available
Great recipe. Simple but fresh and different
It was a great recipe but not one I'd choose again... something about the brocolli/brussels sprout combo I think
more halloumi!
could have provided 20g more halloumi
this was actually disgusting. had someone over for dinner and we had to throw it away. usually happy with recipes. this was a disaster.
"excellent , we just had to add cheese to not be hungry in the evening !"
"Absolutely delicious. The only modification I made was to not put the tortilla chips directly into the soup - might be personal preference, but I thought the soggy chips tasted gross. Very good though"
never received it...
This was basically a nachos plate. Call it what it is. This dinner was the WORST dinner we ever ordered!
More of an appetizer then dinner.
Was so delicious
"More like nachos, not a complete meal, lacking vegetables"
The dip was so good I ate it all before dinner was done!
Haloumi portion WAY too small to two people including one guy.
One of the best recipes I've had so far!
Need more cheese
like a stroganoff
Delicious
If I were to order this again I'd cut the fats a lot. felt very rich for something that could be lighter.
A little too spicy for me but good otherwose
The fresh baked chips are what really stand out in this dish for me.
Would have given 4 stars but not enough cheese to be a filling burger.
Incredibly delicious!!!
"All our chips were very stale, tried hard to cook longer to help. Ended up throwing them away and using tortilla chips. Meat was yummy though."
Challenging to cook
Too many tortillas to topping ratio
"Fairly bland , both the burger and salad needed much more."
The fish came frozen so all the cooking times were off. Food was very cold when the fish was finally done.
This was delicious. It a great way to get the kids to eat the veggies! We loved the flavour.
Steak was delicious. The vegetable were rotten.
Pretty good. Suggest removing the thick spines from the kale before shredding
Great flavour but cold have used some spice. Also would be a little healthier with beef or chicken strips or shrimp over ground beef.
"Celery was not fresh, I suggest a side salad would have been better"
Bok Choy rice was very yummy
Loved this! We added a chicken breast to it for some protein
Didn't care for sauce but came out perfectly cooked.
Carrots a bit heavy on the miso
Wasn't a fan of the BBQ sauce with the limes. Probably would order this one again. However we did like the stir fry in general.
Good
Tasty
This dish was not easy to execute well. There were way too many chips and not enough meat or cheese so lot of the chips came out dry and then it was hard to even find the meat. Tasty ingredients tho.
Awesome
I don’t think we got as many carrots as we should there were only 2 in the bag!
Steak was amazing! Very good meal.
Couldn’t use cilantro on day 4. Rotten.
Delicious! Needed a vegetable
would have prefered if it just had taco chips vs us making them
loved the Parmesan dipping sauce!
The spice mix on the steak was delicious!
Great flavour... the beef was a little sinewy though
Potatoes had many brown spots that needed to be cut away leaving very few pieces but I added some of my own.
The best meal all week. We would happily see this option return more often.
Very filling.
The spinach salad called for too much balsamic vinegar.
A little short on vegetables! I added my own steamed broccoli and carrots.
"As usual, cooking times were underestimated."
This was the reviewer I was most looking forward to as a vegetarian. The rice was mushy and the dish was tasteless. The squash was slimy and unpleasant. This one went into the garbage sorry!
The beef is too chewy even when I cooked it medium rare
chilli was very watery and the tortilla chips burned even thought we booked them less then we were supposed to.
spicy
"Tasted great, but proper lettuce for the bun rather than just using the salad could be nice."
Could have been cheesier
too small of a portion. a piece of cheese between two buns isn’t filling and not good value
Unsubscribe me from your request for reviews.
Potatoes had gone bad
Small portion size of cheese but very tasty!
This meal was highly undesirable. Rice would not separate and dish was difficult to heat through. Nobody in the family enjoyed. Disappointing.
Too small of a serving size
My husband said best dinner yet!!
excellent - but careful with the hot sauce for the rice!
Directions didn’t make sense rm
Needed more cheese for two people.
be careful and only lightly salt the fish
Tasty sauce!
very nice sauce. the pork chops were a bit too small.
A little overpriced
"not enough sauce, elaborate last step more"
The. BEST!!!!!
was really good but not enough for dinner. I had to add chicken to make it a meal
Chips didn’t roast well . Was a little spicier than exspected
I loved it. The kids thought it looked better than tasted.
"Really enjoyed the flavor of this, almost too much noodles for the amount of sauce in between(the peppers appeared to be slightly frozen and soft)"
Really easy to make and delicious
"Not enough halloumi, needs more substance as a dish"
"The kit was not complete, that's twice in one week. This time the tomato paste was not in the bag and neither was the mozzarella. Luckily I had some in the cupboard. My guest loved the meatballs."
Delicious. Brussels sprouts added a nice nuttiness. I suggest adding some nutritional yeast
sauce too acidic
Good recipe and easy to follow but our family wasn’t a major fan of it
Rice was bland.
Plain and mushy.
Surprisingly good and unique
Too acidic for my taste
the spice could use more kick!
This was tasty. Could have used more halloumi though! :)
"excellent ,I'm thinking of adding fried tofu as well"
"recipe sent too much sweet potato, the texture was a bit too thick for the amount of noodles sent"
Loved it and would definitely make again
Too spicy
love it. so delicious.
My carrot was tiny! Would be good to have a bit more veggies in this one
Very tasty!
"Delicious, hardy and easy to make."
"There wasn't enough sauce, so it was fairly dry."
I used less katsu sauce to taste
Not enough food.
the cucumber we got was bad
this recipie was missing the buffalo chicken spice mix so I stupidly used the sauce instead thinking it was a substitute. Not the best meal I’ve ever had
Gravy did not work well
would suggest not boiling the broccoli. just cook it the same was as the Brussel sprouts
mustard does not belong in gravy
kinda bland
Delicious
Great flavour
"1 steak was a little small, one of the carrots' tip was molding, not enough for 2 portions (had to add my own). The garlic received was so small that peeling it destroyed it, used my own. Tasted good."
The brie was almost tasteless because of onions and apple
very tasty!
Recipe said there were supposed to be 15oz of potatoes for 2 servings. I was provided just over half that (8oz)
"so bland , rice wouldn’t break up, needed a lot more water, squash still crunchy after cooking as instructed , small portions"
It need more halloumi cheese. I was expecting more of cheese steak as it tasted more like a burger with only veggies.
"We found there wasn’t enough rice for the both of us. The carrots also went bad, they turned brown and got slimey in the bag."
Vegetables were frozen
Vegetables were frozen.
"just lettuce and cucumbers isn’t a salad; lacks dimension of texture, flavour, and creativity"
Really yummy! More sour cream next time though!
some people might find it too spicy
"Too much starch, not enough vegetables"
excellent meal!
Halloumi
was really good
Sent regular sesame seeds instead of black sesame.
Loved this unique combo! Keep up the great work Chef!
Fish quality could be better
slightly too salty but could have been my error
We added mushrooms and onions
"Chefs Plate, where did you amazing fresh pasta go? ??"
So good!!!!!
"This was quick and tasty - but the garlic wasn't included.No big deal, but it was listed as being provided."
"I would give it 2.5 stars. The recipe card was very unclear on a few steps. It would have been a lot better without the Brussels sprouts, which were quite bitter."
original
"very flat - chicken wasn’t crunchy, veggies and dip is odd for a classic recipe"
"My husband was disappointed that there wasn’t more gravy, the meatballs kind of absorb the liquid. But I thought that made the meatballs really tasty."
delicious
can't go wrong with miki noodles and spicy sauce
best cut of steak I’ve ever had. Delicious plate!
nice snack but not a dinner.
Awful
Delicious recipe!
This was So good. We loved the garlic meso rice.
Mmm I expanded the sauce to make a small gluten free one for my hubby too
this was sooo good. I would have given it four stars if it came with more cheese
Nice easy meal.
Absolutely loved the flavors of this dish!
Delicious!
Butternut squash was not cooked properly
Found the Brussels Sprouts too strong but otherwise tasty.
Good Friday night type easy meal.
Mustard was a little too much in the gravy
Never thought or replacing lettuce with kale. Very tasty.
This was very good but I had to add extra cheese.
"Rice was very clumpy, even after using the “Chef’s Tip”"
Loved it
This was horrible. Bitter and sauce was really bad.
Wasn't to my taste although my partner loved it.
Really delicious. I just added more vegetables.
"Dish was good, instructions for the cheese sauce were a tad unclear and caused a little confusion."
We personally would have liked it a bit spicier! But I do realize not everyone would agree
"Steak was nice, carrots were okay, rice was marginal. Used way too many dishes as well."
