Python is my favorite language for Data Science. In this repository, I plan to share my knowledge and resources with the crowd. I intend to focus on Data Cleaning & Manipulation, Visualization and Modelling.

### Visualization

##### Play with Plotly:  
Plotly is one of my favorite libraries of plotting in Python. One can produce very nice and interactive charts. One can easily make - 
line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplot, etc. It also has great [documentation](https://plot.ly/python/).
