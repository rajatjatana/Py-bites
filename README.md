# Py-bites

Python is my choice of language. Sometimes I use it for my work, sometimes just for solving fun riddles. In this repository, I plan to accumulate my all such experiments. You will find some codes in jupyter notebooks and some will just be .py. 


## Index of Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks

[**Plotly**](Plotly.ipynb): Shows some interactive visualizations using plotly.  

[**Scrapping Data from Excel**](Scrapping_Data_from_Excel.ipynb): Illustrates an approach to automate the task of fetching the data from multiple excel sources.  

[**Spelling Correction Algorithms**](Spelling_Correction_Algorithms.ipynb): interesting approach to get rid of wrong spellings in any text. Now, extract and analyse the text data with ease.

[**Topic Modelling for classifying text reviews**] (Segregate text reviews into different topics.ipynb)
